The UI is clean, intuitive and responsive and once you have everything set up, it is genuinely nice to work with.

        "review_detail": "title: Tracking Work the Jira Way\nreview_detail: Jira has solved a few of our biggest headaches around keeping work visible and organized:\npros: I really like how Jira has added more user-friendly updates recently. Features like Jira Product Discovery, the new automation engine, and simplified boards make it easier for both technical and non-technical teams to collaborate, while improved Slack/Teams integrations help cut down on context-switching.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: Jira can feel overwhelming at times, especially for new users, and the interface gets cluttered. Performance slows on large boards, and it would be great if more lightweight features (like checklists) were built-in instead of relying on costly add-ons.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Project management tool with a bit too much customization potential\nreview_detail: I use Jira every day during the daily standups to discuss the progress of all tickets assigned to members of my team. I mainly use the Kanban Board and Backlog to see if we are still on track and see what we need to schedule for upcoming sprints. The clear UI ensures that we don't forget about important projects and can quickly see if we need to replan our sprint to ensure we handle any problems or delays.\npros: Jira can do pretty much anything you want when it comes to project management (tickets, backlogs, sprint plannings, burndown charts, productivity metrics, you name it). The UI is clean, intuitive and responsive and once you have everything set up, it is genuinely nice to work with. We use it daily, mainly as a Kanban board within the team to discuss our progress in the current sprint. It is easy to update an existing ticket, drag it to the \"review\" or \"done columns\".Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: As mentioned before, Jira can do everything, but I was a bit dissappointed that Jira can't do alot of things out of the box, which means you have to customize things yourself, and there the story is slightly less positive.\n",

The UI is clean, intuitive and responsive and once you have everything set up, it is genuinely nice to work with.

The community forum is a great source of support when trying to accomplish some more complicated tasks, very helpful!Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: Setting up and configuring Jira could be a bit easier, there are a lot of options and they can be quite convoluted. There are quite a few concepts that aren't explained well and can interact together to make it difficult to get the wanted results.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\n",

Features like Jira Product Discovery, the new automation engine, and simplified boards make it easier for both technical and non-technical teams to collaborate, while improved Slack/Teams integrations help cut down on context-switching.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: Jira can feel overwhelming at times, especially for new users, and the interface gets cluttered.

I mainly use the Kanban Board and Backlog to see if we are still on track and see what we need to schedule for upcoming sprints. The clear UI ensures that we don't forget about important projects and can quickly see if we need to replan our sprint to ensure we handle any problems or delays.\npros: Jira can do pretty much anything you want when it comes to project management (tickets, backlogs, sprint plannings, burndown charts, productivity metrics, you name it). The UI is clean, intuitive and responsive and once you have everything set up, it is genuinely nice to work with. We use it daily, mainly as a Kanban board within the team to discuss our progress in the current sprint. It is easy to update an existing ticket, drag it to the \"review\" or \"done columns\".Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: As mentioned before, Jira can do everything, but I was a bit dissappointed that Jira can't do alot of things out of the box, which means you have to customize things yourself, and there the story is slightly less positive.\n",

We’re able to catch issues early thanks to tracking and reporting features, and the integration with AI agents streamlines repeatable operations like triage and prioritization. This has minimized miscommunication and boosted productivity across projects, letting us focus more on core business goals instead of endless status meetingsReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.\npros: Jira stands out for its powerful issue and project tracking capabilities. Over years of use, the customizable workflows have saved so much time, and the Agile boards (Scrum, Kanban) make team collaboration super transparent and organized. The integrations with tools like Slack, Confluence, and GitHub also mean fewer silos and more productivity. It’s scalable for both small projects and enterprise-level work, and the reporting and dashboard features provide great visibility into our progressReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.\ncons: Jira can be overwhelming for new users—there’s a definite learning curve before everything ‘clicks’. Sometimes the interface feels cluttered, and core features are hidden behind a lot of clicks or configuration settings. For smaller or less technical teams, setup and customization might feel like overkill. Also, costs rise quickly as you add users or need more advanced functionality, and certain plugin integrations can be pricey or require extra admin work.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\n",

Being an agile scrum master and experienced project manager, I found that it also helps in consolidating my reporting to stakeholders easily.\ncons: Like several technologies out there , there are a few drawbacks.

When we introduced it, it streamlined a lot of things. Instead of excessive email chains spent looping in different people and not a real good way of tracking all of our projects, who was doing them, how far along they were, JIRA helped to make all of that easier. I could create a ticket and assign it to the developer's manager, and he would assign a develop how he saw fit in terms of efficiency, expertise, among other things. JIRA is really rather simple to use, no fluff, and that's a great thing. It's a no-nonsense software that helps things get done.\ncons: The UI could be prettier, but again it was designed as a no-nonsense program.

It is incredibly easy to track down and track through different tasks and sprints without having the hassle of digging through a 90s-style ticket system. My other absolute favorite thing about JIRA is the simple ability to tag individual users basically anywhere. This saves an incredible amount of time due to the way in which notifications are handled in and outside of the system. Collaboration is beyond easy with JIRA.\ncons: Many of the most important features are being deprecated over time, and the customer service component of the software seems ineffective at best. Some of the best features have been removed and the highest priorities on their roadmap aren't those that would severely increase users' quality of life. I think this is part of a growing process that the company is going through, but it does cause some heartache on the regular to think that our business desires aren't being met - even through months of users requesting the simplest of features.\n",

In my experience, working for a multinational company based in the US West coast and having a developer team in India plus multiple teams inside the company scattered also in Europe and Asia, having a common place so that we can all collaborate through different time zones to make things possible in order for the development to keep advancing is vital. I really like the way you can categorise tasks so that you can clearly see what's its status at a glance which allows you to have the full picture real quick and then assessing what's coming next in the overall plan. Another great feature is that it also serves as a ticketing tool that integrates with the whole development scheme. From there you can create tickets with requests or bugs that can then be resolved or developed accordingly.\ncons: Although very powerful, the platform might be a bit tricky at first when you don't know exactly how to work with it. For smaller companies, the cost of the tool can be a bit high and might not be worth spending that much as they might not profit all of the features at the end.\n",

Namely apps like TestRail & Confluence. * Best part is the backlog, which helps to create/track ticket then and there when required and work on it in future. * Viewing logs is easy as every action is tracked. * Easy filtering options and report generation for project statuses. * Filter out tickets release-wise, helpful for regression.\ncons: For the simplicity of the application, I could hardly think of any major negative points. I faced this situation so just sharing it. If the team member is released from a project he/she has no option to request via.JIRA to dissociate from the Project Board/unsubscribe from getting emails related to the ex-project.

Since it helps to manage multiple tasks under one project it is easy to track the tasks. The ability to use labels when creating issues makes me easy to filter the necessary tickets based on m,y project modules. Jira also enables email notifications once a change is done to Jira tickets which also makes me easier to track the assigned tasks. We use a separate dashboard to track the progress of our sprint in Jira. As Jira has the ability to generate pie charts and graphs it made me easy to present the number of issues encountered, the number of test cases and etc to the management without any struggle. The function to generate sprint reports, burndown charts and velocity graphs in Jira assists our team to get an idea on which parts we need to improve and focus on in the next sprint.\ncons: The learning curve is a bit high in Jira since it has a lot of hidden functionalities that can be used to optimize our day to day work. The scrum master should be more concerend about managing tickets because there is a high chance of creating unecessary tickets and the tickets being misplaced.\n",

We shifted to this software when the pandemic hit and were forced to stay at home since we needed a more powerful software to handle our workflow. If you have a techy team, nothing else compares.\ncons: Biggest con really is that it is not the most user friendly software. Unlike Trello or Asana where you can just go fire it up and it's good to go. This one takes a lot of set-up to do and a deep familiarity with how it works under the hood. Given that the software is one of the older ones, you can sort of see it's age in both the older workflows (issues, screens, etc) vs the newer templates. The newer project templates sort of partially solved this problem but if you need to tweak the settings, it still has a steeper learning curve. The con really here is that i tried Jira with my other less techy company (a school) and adoption was really low as users just weren't able to keep up with it.\n",

It offers a global vision about the work of the team, whether the users are in the same location as if they work in a decentralized way in other delegations or perform teleworking. Order incidents, user histories or tasks from your list by simply dragging and dropping them according to priority. Choose the way to follow the status of the projects of your entire team, with a quick view, with customized panels or even with a predefined report. You will be able to know to which member of your team your work is accumulated, how many projects are still ongoing, which are completed, add an appointment to the calendar, etc. Thanks to the workflow that define the processes, you will allow your team to keep track of the tasks, they can change the status of pending tasks by simply dragging and dropping the task in the corresponding column in the kanban panels.

Filters are hard to apply, and different filters are missing. Minor issues can be a real nuisance and slow down the work - for example links will open in the same window, overriding the task you have just been looking at.

        "review_detail": "title: JIRA is a functional agile project management application\npros: Jira is a fantastic tool for managing projects. It is the finest choice for managing agile projects and bug tracking. Jira makes it possible to utilize several teams at once, creating a lot of connections. Teams from the product development, product design, and product strategy divisions may collaborate to better projects. Using the filtering and searching tools, each team may keep track of its own deliverables, milestones, and tasks. If you are leveraging the Agile Scrum framework, implementing custom views will help to assist your daily stand-up sessions. You might create your own distinctive points of view to talk just on the important components of the assignments. This function is efficient and saves time for a daily ten-minute stand-up. Other new features that make Jira a must-buy include alerts for due dates, assignment distribution, labelling, assigning task priority levels, and generating epic connections that display the user narrative and project progress. Jira has Kanban boards where you may choose between showing and hiding features from other team members. Due to its capacity to integrate with many frameworks and maintain task and deliverable backlogs, Jira offers a great level of flexibility. Jira has excellent organization in its sprint planning, sprint release, and history structure. Any type of project management may use it. Customer assistance is offered by Jira, which is quite helpful.\ncons: My own opinion is that it's a fantastic tool; one of the dew drawback is the cost per user, which initially looks good but increases overtime. Another drawback I've seen when using Jira is that there isn't an option to have audible notifications. When a new ticket is created, Jira, for instance, doesn't make a sound. So, if a user leaves the system, they risk missing a vital ticket.\n",

Everyone has their own work areas inside JIRA. It is difficult to say in few words what JIRA is, it is a complete suite for a software development company and I'd suggest you try out JIRA no matter the size of your team. My main work areas and familiarity are the backlog, story management and issue reporting. JIRA acts as the single source of truth with its easy to use Epic and Story feature which makes the life of a product owner very comfortable. The development teams are then able to do their story estimations and sprint planning all in the same place. I would highly recommend you to try JIRA even if you are a startup or a big software house.\ncons: JIRA has a learning curve (at least for me, coming from a non-technical or project management background) but with a bit of training (can be done by yourself) it is not that hard to get up and running.

It's extremely flexible tool where you can configure your own workflows and customize it as per your project's needs. It's my go-to Agile project management tool (especially for Scrum). It's so easy to create and manage user stories, bugs, technical tasks etc. You can tag your user stories as per Epics and Features, you can also add labels to each ticket. You can track the status of any ticket and also see the bandwidth allocation of various teams. In JIRA, you can add advanced search filters to view only those user stories that has particular combination of fields (like specific assignee, status, epic name etc.). Moreover, JIRA Dashboard provides a bird's eye view of the overall project status which gives the real time visibility to you and the leadership team. The UI is very clean and simple and it makes Agile Development very productive, once you get the hang of it. Plus, it's very well integrated with many popular apps like Google workplace, workday, slack etc. But there is definitely a steep learning curve with Jira. The success of this product largely depends on how your management/leadership standardize various processes and workflows within Jira.\ncons: Jira doesn't allow you to add multiple assignee on one user story, and this becomes a concern when multiple developers are working on one story. Also, it's hard to get support from Atlassian when you are facing some technical issues. Additionally, in my experience, I have found that as Jira provides great level of customization, it can become really messy, if multiple management styles are involved during project planning phase. The workflows can get overly complicated and as a Product Owner, you find yourself stuck in updating the ticket statuses all day long.\n",

We use the default settings for the most part and that works great for us. There is no need to train anyone on how to use it because everything is self-explanatory. That cuts down on confusion and allows us to get/enter accurate information.\ncons: It is slow. It is very slow at times. Jira's makers - Atlassian - have not paid much attention over the years about its slowness. If you are into full-fledged project management, portfolio planning and more, you will have to buy add-ons to get additional functionality within Jira. Did I say that Jira is slow? While the ease of use saves time in accurately recording information in Jira, all that saved time is wasted away waiting for pages to load.\n",

Also, the Smart Query feature is not that useful, many times basic search work well.- Doesn't have the templates to write detailed documents such as FSD or a design document, not a very good knowledge management tool.\n",

It is able to provide a good track of our records and customer complains, and it is a very good monitoring tool for all our cases. I have used several / different software for this job, and I can certify that JIRA is the best tool (even if it is more expensive compared with the competition). The customers are also very happy with our reaction time and the way we are treating the cases with JIRA (writing text, sending attachements and pictures, highlighting text etc.)... it is kind of the best customer support tool that we used so far.\ncons: Even if JIRA is a great product, it is not perfect. There are some things that I do not like. One of them is the response time, which quite often is slow, and after I click one menu it take 5 seconds to load the page. Other issue is the refresh rate: sometimes I update cases but on the main page they are not updated. Also, if I refresh the page, I receive the old status first and only after 5-10 seconds it gets updated to the latest status. The search function is not the best, as sometimes is missing some results that I am actually looking for.\n",

For planning, we found it especially useful to visualise projects, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress in a way that kept everyone aligned. The integrations with other tools (like Slack and Confluence) also added a lot of value.\ncons: Personally, I found that it can be overwhelming if you don’t have someone internally who really understands how to configure it properly. The setup isn’t always intuitive for non-technical teams, and without regular maintenance, it can get messy quickly.

Issue tracking and workflows allows for easy tracking, bug fixing and feature development, allowong for cross team collaboration, with clear reporting features to understand dev team efficiency.\ncons: Jira, although a tool of choice does come with a steep learning curve and to some extent, a complex UI. With large instances, going with the cloud solution can be beneficial, but also has the potential for some performance issues with large instances. Due to the flexibility of Jira, although great for dev teams cuatomising their own methodology, there is a risk of over-customisation which could lead to causing complexity. There is a mobile app, but there are many limitations, and it used more for updates rather than working within the app. There are many addons, but there is a potential to add cost to your base subscription, this can cause the total solution cost to be high.\n",

Not only gives you a good insight on how long it will take to develop something, but also how much you will invest on it. I will highly recommend it to any start up or person with new professional objectives/goals within a company.\ncons: It really does take time to understand how everything works and connects. I believe the user interface is well designed, but in the end, the experience sometimes can get a little tricky or hard to navigate such a big platform. I can see there's an effort to put things in their respected categories, but I think this is something you can always keep improving. I really needed my managers to help me go through Jira when I first put my hands into it, but its like everything. You have to invest time to learn it properly, although I remember it to be a bit frustrating at first.\n",

You need the commitment of the team to use it and a quick walk-through on expectations, but once you've done that, you have a great archive of all of your tasks and a workflow management system that helps you to prioritize the right work at the right time while not losing track of issues or functionality.\ncons: Custom configuration is time consuming and frustrating. Best to use what it has out of the box and don't try to make many changes - adapt your workflow to the screens and you'll be happier.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Sophisticated and efficient project management tool\npros: Jira is an excellent project management tool. It is the best option for bug tracking and agile project management. Multiple teams can use Jira at the same time leading to a lot of integrations. Teams including product strategy, product design, and product development can collaborate together leading to improvement in project. Each team can track their individual milestones, deliverables, and tasks using the filter and search functionality. If you are using an Agile Scrum framework, your daily standup meetings are well supported by using custom views. You can create your own custom views to discuss only the relevant issues of the tasks. This feature is time saving and efficient for a daily ten minutes standup. The other new features that make Jira a must buy are due dates notification, assignment allocation, labels, assigning priority levels to tasks, and developing epic links which displays the user story and the project progress. For Kanban framework users, Jira provides Kanban boards where you can turn on and off features that you want to display or hide from other members. Jira provides high flexibility with features that maintain the tasks and deliverable backlogs and these features are applicable to different frameworks. Sprint planning, releasing sprint, and organizing history is very organized in Jira. It can be used for any type of project management. Customer support is available for Jira, which is very helpful.\ncons: Jira has deficiencies on micro level. For a particular task, if you are maintaining the workflow, it is hard to customize the columns. Jira always displays all columns on a single view, more like a static view without scrolling. This leads to columns being smaller in width with smaller font size text, which sometimes become hard to read. Unavailability of scrolling leads to column being fit in a single screen browser. Pricing is also an issue. Jira is expensive and fits very well in the budget of big enterprises, but many for small sized firms it is a hard pass. Also, limited user excess to Jira makes it challenging to most small size companies. There is a trade off between ease of use and efficiencies. User has to have good knowledge of Jira navigation and customization before he can make the project management efficient. Customer support is helpful, but comes at an added price. Overall, customization, ease of use, and price are the biggest drawback for Jira right now.\n",

We can easily keep a track of the features and the issues which are being currently worked on and what is the progress of the issues being worked on. We use Jira for all the project management and for planning out the sprints. There are many charts like Gantt chart and Kanban which helps to track the progress of the project.\ncons: The mobile application for Jira is not that great and it is a little bit of laggy sometimes and the UI also could be much better. Apart from this the pages on Jira should auto refresh when a change has been made. Whenever some change has been made it just gives a warning or instruction to refresh the page to reflect those changes.\n",

It is very flexible and fitted really well with agile development work. whether you are using kanban or standard sprint planning work flow, it supports all of those. 2. It is extremely useful to do project planning and creating stories, they will be saved in backlogs and you can access them with weight, estimate and priority. 3. It is quick to create a bug ticket to track bugs. 4. It is very easy to plan for a new sprint, by adding task, stories from the backlogs, it helps with the total points you want to target for a particular sprint, it automatically sum up the story points and make sure you don't over plan. 5. great report tool to help you analyse the project completion and nice burn down chart as well. To help the team retrospectively go back and review.\ncons: 1. It is a big over complex by providing such flexible functionalities. But it is worth the time and learning curve. 2. As a developer, I don't have to pay the bill. But it is not very cheap if you have a large development team, the bills add up quickly.\n",

Wether it's with regards to each teams workflow, like having different stages on the software development life cycle, or with stuff like the fields needed for each requirement or ticket, it managed to cover most of our needs. Also the integration with other tools is excellent, we triggered Jenkins jobs right from within Jira and also updated the tickets back and all worked perfectly.\ncons: Some of the stuff can only be achieved by external (and most of the time, paid) plugins. In particular we had to get a Zephyr plugin to track testing and some other things. It can also be a bit difficult to setup, but that's a tradeoff with being customisable so it's understandable.\n",

There is a bit of a learning curve to understand how all the components fit together, but once you get the hang of it its pretty smooth. The automation feature are easy and fun to implement.\ncons: My main gripes about Jira are the fact that Atlassian often makes update to the software assuming that the change benefits all their customers, when often it does not. Then despite numerous complaints they stand behind their change. I understand the need to evolve and make updates, however they can achieve this by making the new features optional with a toggle switch so users have the choice whether to use them or not. We use Jira Service Management to manage inbound support requests for clients. For privacy reasons the software no longer displays the user's email address but we need this information to identify the client. This can be problematic at times. Lastly, reporting options are sometimes limited and we need to rely on 3rd party plugins to provide information for an added cost.\n",

The things I like most about JIRA are how customizable workflows are, the availability of additional third party plugins, and how well it integrates with other atlassian products. The integration with other atlassian products improves our workflow significantly in IT and development, it allows us to link git commits through FishEye and documentation pages through Confluence to every JIRA issue. JIRA's customized workflows also help us stay accountable to eachother. Because the workflows have specific permissions and assignees built into steps in what we do they help insure that the right person does the right thing at the right time. I don't think we could work without JIRA or something similar.\ncons: The software has gotten progressively slower over the last few revisions. That's my only complaint.

        "review_detail": "title: Powerful project management, SDLC and bug management software for agile teams\npros: I've used JIRA a few times, along with Confluence when I was on contract with a few large enterprise digital teams. I found JIRA to be excellent as a tool to share files, track project conversation streams, and manage multiple versions of files through the project lifecycle. Though I only ever used JIRA from an end user perspective, I always heard great things about the customizability (it seems to be a word) of the app to different business processes. Digital teams, such as UX design, development and copywriting are an ideal use case for this app provided stories and projects are set up properly. It's a great way to give stakeholders and PMs and other managers visibility into how projects are trending against milestones.\ncons: There were a few outages when I used JIRA, but it was generally reliable. JIRA seems to be one of those business applications where you're only using a fraction of its capability. Administration access should really be restricted to a qualified few, as you don't want to have conflicting stories tracking the same project, telling different information. The success of a JIRA implementation/adoption really relies on the quality of the data users, PMs, and development managers put into it. I found that I was writing a lot of updates and @ing people all over the place on one contract, yet certain PMs were still asking me for updates. That was less a JIRA problem, and more a condition of the people I was working with though, so I won't name names. :) - Moral of the story, you get out of JIRA what your teams put in, like many enterprise apps.\n",

The most impactful for us was the integration done with Zenddesk our ticketing system. Our support engineers are able tie Zenddesk tickets to our Jira issues and when issues are updated, so is the Zenddesk ticket. Very Cool! 2) Notifications were very well done in Jira. There is an in-app notification system (A bell in the bottom corner) but they can also be sent via email. They also are very smart about sending you only updates that involve you so that you are not notified too much. 3) Smart task ordering and prioritizing that work well in a development environment.\ncons: Most of the cons that I noticed are rather nit-picky however I believe there is room for lots of improvement. 1) Give for example the sprint page. There is a little star in the upper right corner. If I hover over the star I get a description that says 'Star'. That is not a great description of what that button will do for me. Users are dumb and won't figure things like that out on their own. 2) I think the UI is a tiny bit clunky. I see lots of wasted space here and there. Often times there are things that do not seem that important that seem to take up a lot of space. Also I'm not a big fan of huge collapsable side menus. 3) The many features that are offered in Jira make for a steep learning curve.\n",

I believe Agile methodology brings out the best from JIRA and completely utilizes it to it's best potential, From flexible and rapid Issue creation and updation to have easily traceable developing environment, It does all with ease. Managers and Scrum Masters can not have a single meeting without JIRA Kanban Board. Every issue, every story is traced with in-depth details. from it's creation, execution till it's completion, Even after completion the history of every issue is maintained and can be over viewed with ease.\ncons: From feature perspective there are no such feature to dislike about JIRA. They're simple and easy to accomplish, Operations like Creating or Editing Issue(s) are easy and can be done by anyone. There lies the problem of such operations performed by any one. Rather they should have some access level of control with which they can initialize on individual issue to individual member involved with that issue. Even if someone does edit an issue on accident, they should atleast be prompt about the changes they're about to make, or save. and only after successful confirmation from the user, JIRA should allow those changes to be saved.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Jira: An Essential Task Management Application\npros: I use Jira for Project Management in my occupation. As a worker in a large enterprise, Jira does a phenomenal job of creating a fantastic user experience for both desktop and mobile. I think mobile project management is especially intuitive with this service. Where Jira stands apart from other standard project management tools is in its ability to track issues throughout an entire development lifecycle. Tickets are an essential component to keeping work organized and teams moving forward. The ability to collaborate via comments is unparalleled. Jira also offers extensive add-ons and pre-created templates for those just learning the service. When tracking projects, I never felt overly-encumbered by high learning curves or a clunky interface. Jira allowed me to work with many of the tools I am comfortable with and expand my potential.\ncons: From my experience, the largest pain-point / decision point between my team is on the issue of creating 'tickets'. While Jira is a very detail oriented application, this detail can sometimes become quite cumbersome. For example, the process of creating and resolving tickets can sometimes feel even longer than completing the task itself. Furthermore, it is difficult, if not impossible to close a ticket if you are not the creator. Therefore, project managers need to carry significant oversight as task statuses change. Therefore, tickets are very controversial but also an essential component to completing work successfully on this platform.\n",

Without that commitment, JIRA can be offputting and seem like a heavy mess of a system.

The core advantage of the tool - it's lack of structure - make it difficult to complete even the simplest of tasks without a ridiculous amount of effort. It's biggest failing is that everything is too flat by default. For example, I am working on a project now and the team has made duplicate tickets because the original tickets are too hard to find and are just dumped on the screen... we have sometimes used epics/stories/sub-tasks with sprints but these are truly inadequate... in today's time why should someone have to spend 20-30 hours a week grooming the backlog and writing searches when if the tool was any good it should (!!) be able generate these views automatically. We are now investigating other solutions like Wrike (absolutely no affiliation, not even sure we will switch to it) and in 10 minutes of testing we were getting views that we have been struggling to get out of JIRA for over a year. Also, you can't do something obvious like make a reminder in the future for a ticket, so you either get flooded with reminders for just about everything or you have to go outside the product to remind you to do something in JIRA. Seriously!?!\n",

We can easily import test scripts from excel sheets with help of third party tools like zephyr.\ncons: Setting filters cannot be easy sometimes and might not retrieve desired output every now and then.

Jira is used by teams ranging in size from two to 20,000 to manage every stage of their process, from planning to shipping and releasing. Teams may use native roadmaps to organise their work and keep track of the big picture. With a few clicks, Jira's no-code automation engine helps teams to save time and gain power by automating any operation or process. And, with a free edition, teams of up to 10 members may use all of Jira's features for free, forever.\ncons: The results of the activities can be a little shaky at times, but nothing to be concerned about. Also, while availability may certainly be enhanced by using a private cloud, there are still some hitches here and there. I believe bug tracking is the area that can be improved the most.

For a long period, I was a big fan of Bugzilla. However in my previous company, when we have migrated to Atlassian Jira, it was a very difference experience. When the entire organization moved more in to agile, the product also changed priorities around understanding customers' problems. The migration was tough as we were not in a position to ignore the requirements from our users. The import functionality helped us a lot and thanks to our engineering team to put huge effort in doing research on Jira. I love the way information is organized across, projects, boards with decent agile reporting capabilities. Being in product management, I have enjoyed the flow of user stories, backlog review, estimation, roadmap and Atlassian Jira's functionality to customize workflow. The transparency which Jira brings to the product management team is a big plus. What we are working on, what is going to come next and when, what is in the pipeline are a big relief to any customer facing product development organization. Another beauty is the categorization of user stories and epics, which helps the product owners to start filtration of issues at the entry level itself. The knowledge handover from product team to other teams collaborating for product success ( Eg:- CS, Marketing) became seamless with Jira. The dashboards are great for monitoring purpose. Finding Jira, an effective and comprehensive solution to ensure that every action in a user story is accounted and traceable across the product life cycle without loosing the goal of delivering iterative and incremental value to customers, as fast as possible.\ncons: I like learning new things. Jira require good learning and is not a very light tool. The user interface act a bit confusing sometime. Setup, project/workflow creation, user management etc. are tough tasks and require brains from Dev ops with good knowledge of agile practices.\n",

The primary spot in this class is held by Wrike which has an aggregate score of 9.8/10 and is the champ of our Best Project Management Software Award for 2017.

Its straightforward, natural interface empowers joint effort with partners and enables you to take care of business in a viable way. Jira tailors itself to fit to the necessities of the business and gives fantastic help to finish everything. The level of customization enables the product to properly fit distinctive business needs. This product can be utilized by an organization. I have designed JIRA to be utilized by distributing organization, by law office, and obviously, IT organizations. What's more, it was conceivable to make everybody content with what JIRA gives. Despite the fact that occasionally it was difficult to encourage individuals how to utilize it, following multi month or two they couldn't recollect how they lived without it.\ncons: Jira is an amazing programming, however with a lot of capacities comes a large group of devices and assignments to learn, especially for new clients. As of late JIRA refreshed its outline. My clients whine about new outline, I get insane when I can't discover things. Furthermore, JIRA wouldn't like to stop at that and is refreshing its plan further and further. I would truly incline toward that they glance through bugs that were raised on comunity entryway and accomplish something in regards to new highlights as opposed to doing configuration refreshes. It is imperative to realize that Jira gives us awesome help to the client, and their consideration is a need, however ordinarily they don't figure the issue. It is a component to survey in Atlassian. - The prologue to Jira's reality is required to be as mysterious as its interface and execution. Actually it is intricate to fabricate channels and move around in the application when the client is new. - You need to run a right download of the reports toward the finish of the month or toward the finish of the week, the reports are conveyed in spreadsheets, however with an introduction that fails to impress anyone, thusly, when setting the dates they ought to have pretty much days so you can play out the download effectively.\n",

Many fields are customizable and that helps with reporting.\ncons: Once Jira is initially configured, it is difficult to make changes. For example with custom fields. Past administrators over-used custom fields. We cannot just rename them or merge them, we are stuck with them unless we go through a cumbersome process to remove individually. Meanwhile the whole system runs slowly because of the overwhelming number of custom fields. So we are stuck in a purgatory where we do not have bandwith to make the system work better.\n",

I like how easy it is to do things like update my tasks, see the team's work, add files to items and connect between the various tools like Stride and Confluence. As an admin, there is a lot of customization I can do regarding workflow. My team has changed as we've grown and fleshed out both our development and QA process, so having that flexibility to modify the Jira workflow has been incredibly helpful. I also like the fact that Jira integrates with virtually every other major piece of software, such as Slack.\ncons: Most of my complaints with Jira software comes from the admin side. Because it has so much customization, it's often hard to know where something is or how you need to modify it in order to customize it. The documentation leaves a lot to be desired, and searching the web usually takes you to outdated documentation or a community forum post. Between the two, I usually can find what I need. Generally, the biggest gap between documentation and what I'm doing is that the UI has been updated and things moved around. The actual information is solid, but entire menu items have disappeared or been renamed. Oftentimes, I think I have found what I need and roll the dice and check this box or press that button, and it works. I've never run into anything that couldn't be immediately undone.\n",

I like the ease of creating tickets as well as lists, which simplifies us to follow up on all products and customer feedback with high efficiency. I like the ease of allocating tickets to team members so that it increases the flexibility of follow-up, and the project manager can constantly obtain reports that cover all stages of workflow and accurately describe the team’s achievement.\ncons: In general, not much negative, but the use of Jira requires extensive training by the team members so that they can use all the functions efficiently. Sometimes when dealing with a large number of tasks Jira can take time, but this is not an issue that comes up often.\n",

User stories, epics, issue management, backlog management, task assignment, tracking charts for scrum, kanban boards etc give you the visibility you need when operating in an multi-team Agile development structure. The visibility of the state of your project(s) and workflow is the key benefit for using this software in an enterprise environment. Another key benefit is you can extend to use Atlassian's suite of products where there is great integration such as Service Desk, Confluence & Stride - although most of our teams eventually developed a preference for Slack.\ncons: JIRA can be a little complex at the outset to the uninitiated, some tasks require searching for in the menu system. Customization does have an overhead attached, for example adding attributes with logic etc. Email notifications can be overwhelming if you are attached to multiple teams, a digest option would probably be better than one email per update.\n",

The integrations with Teams work smoothly and help us to keep track of the comments we make on developments in Teams as well as link to an issue in Jira.\ncons: The workflow management could be improved on the project settings as you have to remove an existing workflow to edit it, and it is sometimes tedious. Bulk edits may be slow sometimes.\n",

The ability to set colors to epic is also very nice and supportive of a quick review of how many epics team is committing to for sprint planning\ncons: Lack of ability to have a visual roadmap/timeline and move epics around it. Instead of having a ppt, it would be good to have a board built for epic and product roadmaps within JIRA itself as another tab on the navigation pane or at least an integration with Miro, beautiful.ai, or Mural The settings controlled by an admin in large companies causes too many impediments for scrum teams The ability to query certain data is not intuitive for all users\n",

It has multiple views and is used to manage projects, so people who want to see an overview of the work can use the To-do List or simply the Roadmap, and team members who are trying to balance their daily activities can use the Dashboard to plan their workload.

You can also trigger the transitions on the boards for 'lazier' teams when they commit or merge a branch, meaning you dont have to chase after devs to update the board. You can also build the board to be as simple or complex as a team needs it to be. Jira adjusts to your needs, not the other way around. The sister applications to Jira are also amazing (Confluence, etc)\ncons: For repetitive tasks that have a set format, Jira, out of the box at least without pricy add-ins is not able to automatically do this.

Ease of creating multiple tickets as well as placing them into different projects without having to be in the projects portal. Creating reports to review metrics is relatively easy, it was useful in an integrated project to review estimated times reported in previous sprints to project development times for other projects. The flexibility of how tickets look and editable fields as well as workflows to tailor to the team and/or project being worked on.\ncons: The bad part of Jira's flexibility is that settings are all over the place and you typically need to refer to Jira's knowledge base on how to configure custom settings whether it is for fields inside of tickets, workflow settings and automations, and many other settings. The standard Jira end user interface is not exactly user friendly and some things may not make sense depending on the team using it such as a ticket being in a closed state however the resolution state has separate \"states\" such as do, don't do which is more used by software development teams. Jira typically requires a lot of customization when setting up new projects either for project managers, agile software development teams, or integrated project teams. As an administrator this can be difficult to convey to my end users who want to track their projects in Jira. This is where you need to have great communication with your end users to be able to setup and tailor the Jira project to their needs and improve the overall Jira experience.\n",

There was a shell created by our IT team and it was a great start but with the help of an intern he and I were able to completely change and enhance the user experience on both sides for those who enter tickets and those who work or engage with tickets. The system seems a little overwhelming at first because it offers so many variations however once you really consider what you want to do and who you want to achieve it really straightforward. You're able to change and modify just about every aspect of the interface so that its complete company-specific or even department-specific is you choose. You can make it look like its an extension of your companies actual website. You can access and run reports for so many different KPI's or metrics to see preformance or SLA's and they are all realtime.\ncons: Like I stated it was a bet overwhelming bacause there are so many options and changes that can be made using JIRA however there are tons of resources as well.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Jira: A Must-Have Tool for Streamlining Software Development Team's Workflow\npros: I appreciate Jira for its ability to streamline my team's workflow and improve our efficiency. The ability to track and manage tasks and bugs in a centralized location makes it easy for us to stay organized and on top of our workload. Additionally, the collaboration features such as comments and mentions, allow my team to communicate and stay on the same page in real-time. Furthermore, I found Jira to be very scalable, it adapts well to our team's growing needs. Overall, Jira has become a vital tool in our development process.\ncons: I would say that one thing I like least about Jira is that it can have a bit of a learning curve for new users. It has a lot of features and options, and it may take some time to become familiar with all of them. Additionally, some users may find the interface to be a bit cluttered and overwhelming. Furthermore, the customizing and configuring the workflows to fit the specific needs of my team can be a bit difficult and time-consuming. But once you get used to it, you'll find that Jira is a powerful and flexible tool that can help your team to be more productive and efficient.\n",

The sprints provide guardrails to teams take smaller chunks of work. Jira provides a centralized location to work in and can reduce the amount of communication gaps.\ncons: The greatest opportunity Jira has is that the user experience is rough in the fact that the product needs in-depth training to properly use it. For example, there aren't any youtube tutorials or best practices documents on why the end user would use label or a component. Most project leaders I know do not have a standardization why they use that and it causes confusion on project teams. The product isn't a plug and play, it is more that any user will need several lessons on simple actions such as creating a story, creating a Jira board, and creating Jira JQL. At the end of the day, there is a steep learning curve for this product and that increases the resistance for enterprise teams to go agile.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Jira...the best out there\npros: Jira is highly customisable, and also has plugins. It allows you to monitor your projects and provided granulated access to individuals. You (or your admin) can set roles for the project and associates those roles to certain activities and then associate the roles even further to individuals. You can organize your tickets in sprints and releases as well as monitor workload and task assignment to your team during sprints (or whatever other form of software delivery you wish to choose).\ncons: Pricing model. Currently, you have a choice of server vs cloud setup. If you have a team that can maintain the server instance, I'd recommend going to server because you have a lot more plugins you can use on server and you can set it up the way you want. The best thing is the licenses are a one-time cost, as opposed to lower, but monthly and forever costs on the cloud portion. The other thing that is to be considered is that the plugins you choose need to have the same level of range for hte user count. i.e if your jira is for 101-250 users, all your plugins will need a license level of the same range, i.e 101-250 users. Something to consider if you are thinking about moving to Jira.\n",

If you take the time to customize the interface, add fields, workflows, etc. that match your business model, JIRA can make your organization so much more transparent and efficient. Combined with it's siblings Confluence, BitBucket, et. al. you have an amazing suite of productivity tools. Each individual may feel that they are doing a little more than they used to when adding information into these tools, but the time saved in meetings, querying peers for information & not having the full picture will soon become apparent. To get the most of JIRA, be prepared to customize and train. Without those two pieces, you may end up with users who don't see or feel the benefit.\ncons: The least appealing thing about JIRA and the other tools in the Atlassian suite is the fact that you must buy plug-ins to get a lot of functionality that should have been built in. Atlassian is proud of their App ecosystem, but, from an end user perspective, it can just feel like it is a place grabbing your money.\n",

Multiple users can get involved within the platform and have different subtasks assigned to them. Having the possibility to create workflows keep things simple and easy to see what's the current status of the whole task at a glance. The platform allows for customisation as well, this comes really handy as no project is identical and you may need to add some automations to the process to meet your specific needs. Thanks to their recent Boards implementation, you can see the next tasks that need to be worked on and as well as what's already been done and what's in progress.\ncons: The platform might be a bit overwhelming when you start working with it for the first time. It's hard to know all the possible functionalities until you have worked with it for a while. Although it's possible to customise, some parts can get a bit tricky to perform if you don't have the knowledge. On the other side, you can also reach out to them if you need help.

Developers can easily use GIT or TFS to check-in or commit data on the respective servers whereas testers can file relevant bugs or issues encountered for the relevant tasks under a User story. Overall, this is a great project management tool to use.\ncons: As compared to other platforms like Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services), this tool doesn't provide much more features and support for functionalities. Anyone would prefer to use Azure DevOps as it is a complete DevOps solution as well as a Project management tool with decent pricing for corporates and also free pricing for a team of 5.\n",

It's good for larger organizations with several cross-functional teams, but if you are a smaller organization stick with Trello and checklists for the cards if sub-tasks are needed.

You boss who is always a watcher can also comment if he/she thinks you are wasting your time or should be working on something of higher priority (helps the boss who loves micromanaging). I particularly like the way you can use epics to pools similar tasks and then make sub-task to link them to other tasks etc.\ncons: It has made most of the places so efficient that before when I worked as an intern, my boss would brief me on what I had to do daily. Nowadays I get a steady list of tasks which I need to sometimes write back and forth before knowing exactly what to do - sometimes a good old fashioned face-to-face would be helpful - so maybe this is a flaw in management rather than the fault of the tool.\n",

I think the best part about it is that it's an easy yet full way for QA personnel to submit bugs to the teams responsible for them. We can communicate through it back and forth regarding the issue and status. It's easy to see what issues remain open vs already addressed.\ncons: JIRA can get overwhelming, in one sense because you get tons of e-mails from it. Aside from cutting that back a bit, for example, the company could develop other ways for notifications that need to be seen by team members, in a desktop application tool. So, in such a case, the desktop would continually be running through the day, and JIRA could stream a notification to the tool. It could make its appearance by simply highlighting the tool in the toolbar. That's one way. People should be able to choose how they get notifications from JIRA. Some will prefer e-mail, others this tool, and others who really need to stay on top of everything, could get text alerts. JIRA should expand even more, and be more of a project lifecycle tool.\n",

Overall, the software has everything you need to move a project forward, especially with large teams. Customer support was also friendly when we contacted them over a technical glitch that was interrupting a project. They're not the fastest but they're fast enough. Got the issue resolved.\ncons: As a PM of a very dynamic company, jumping from project to project was the daily standard. The biggest issue we had with this software was not being able to open multiple timers at the same time. We had to run one, stop it, log it, then open a new one, do the same and return to the first timer again. Rinse and repeat. We ended up replacing the time tracking with a whole different software and syncing it. Also, customizing the boards and features is pretty finnicky. You'll find yourself going down a rabbit hole to find anything. The interface is always changing too so once you figure something out you'll just have to re-figure it out later. Introducing a new team member to the software was always a long process. It can seem overwhelming to the inexperienced and has quite the learning curve.\n",

If you learn it well you can make it work in almost any organization - which is a skill you can use between jobs!\ncons: Jira isn't very intuitive to use and setup when you first start using it. They are making a conscious effort to simplify it with the new next-gen projects, which does help, but the UI is often slow and requires waiting between screens loading too often, which can be annoying at times.\n",

I like it because it is very complete, it has many sprint reports, and it allows you to segment the data in a useful way. It has personalized filters on which to later visualize the information that is useful.\ncons: I don't have much to complain about this tool, except that sometimes the interface is updated and it becomes a bit complex to adapt to the new features, but they are always improvements that ultimately help us to have better control with planning and administration. The interface could be better, a bit more user friendly to make it easy and intuitive.\n",

Furthermore, the mobile version of Jira is so limited that it's more practical to access it through a web browser. Although it is a basic software, it is quite expensive compared to other similar services that offer more functionality for a lower cost.\n",

It has facilities to manage agile projects very efficiently. Their issue tracking system is also very convenient. There are further extended facilities which can be integrated with JIRA(such as Confluence) offered again by Atlassian\ncons: Sometimes there has been a learning curve(not much) for me to understand the access privileges of different users.(what admins can do, what normal users can do and can't do). There has also been certain instances in agile sprints where it's difficult to find certain tasks and issues after assigning to a upcoming sprint which has not been started yet. But this is showing correctly in the sprint board after starting the sprint. Better if they can improve it in a suitable way.\n",

You can easily track which team members spent their time working on certain issues, giving you insight into how your projects are progressing. (This could also be a con if you work in a more collaborative environment). Pro 2: Easy Project Management Prioritizing tasks is an essential aspect of project management. With its dashboards, Jira allows you to prioritize projects by quickly identifying which are progressing well and which need help. With a quick glance at your dashboard, you can easily prioritize what’s next for your project teams.\ncons: Con 1: Technical Issues Projects created in Jira have an issue type called technical that is often confused with bugs. Because issue types are pre-defined by default, it’s hard to use your own words to describe what a technical issue is. When you create an issue for a bug or technical problem, there’s no way to group it with other issues about similar problems so users can focus on problems across several projects at once. Con 2: Difficult to Get Support The biggest negative about JIRA is that it's tough to get support when you need it. This is due to Atlassian's heavy reliance on their community forums, which are frequently inundated with low-quality questions from new users. If you have a complicated issue, or your problem isn't being addressed in any forum threads, Atlassian's usually helpful but small team of professional service agents (PSAs) may be a better bet than waiting for help from other users.\n",

On one project, we needed a comprehensive picture of task progress in real time.

What I love the most is even after several years, hundreds of Software Developers, dozens of Atlassian University courses later... I AM STILL continuing to find more and more amazing ways to utilize this tool and not have to purchase other tools when Jira can nearly do it all!\ncons: It being so very customizable, and having many folks using it, it's just the training period for onboarding new users. It's not awful and it's literally not Jira's fault, it's more of a people thing. Some folks just don't take the extra second to embrace the awesome powers of Jira.\n",

As a designer, it has completely revolutionized the way I work by organizing my workflow, allowing me to collaborate with my team in real time, and keep track of my assets and tasks. Their granular system for categorizing tasks has proven to be amazing for me and my team.\ncons: I wish I could search by file name to quickly find assets for re-download or link a specific ticket to teammates who may need to reference a ticket where I know a specific asset is located. Otherwise, I have zero complaints about Jira. It is super powerful and has all the collaboration tools I could ever want.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Jira Atlassian software online is the best but could easily be so much better!\npros: I like how I can organize my team, so we're rowing in the right direction when it comes to software development. With Jira, it is easy to check the board for what the team is currently doing, what is not started yet, and what needs to be pushed across the finish line. It is honestly the best software out there for what it does. Backlog grooming is done well using this software as well. I like being able to customize swim lanes.\ncons: If you want to do anything more than just customize how many swimlanes you have on your active jira board, it gets complex really quick with ticket statuses. I often times cannot do what I want to do without going into a million screens to figure it out. And even then, I end up not having enough permission to do what I want to customize what is displayed when you drag a ticket from one column to another, etc. Nightmare. Also, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Jira, get with the program and follow standard linking convention. If I link to a web site that is NOT on the same domain, open it in a new tab or window. DO NOT open it in the same browser tab. This is just wrong. Local links (same domain) can open in the same tab, but foreign links should open in a new tab. Period. It drives me crazy when I click on a link in a comment and I get busy and then wonder where my backlog went! This happens way more than I'd like to admit. Also, one more simple game-changing request that the software currently doesn't do: When I'm backlog grooming, I'd like to group select a bulk set of tasks and figure out how much time estimate in aggregate they all are. Nowhere can I do this easily unless I literally make a fake sprint and shove them all in it. PLEASE add a summation at the bottom of the screen for when multiple tasks are highlighted, like how spreadsheets sum selected cells automatically! I should NOT have to go to great lengths just to see what several task estimates/story points sum to.\n",

Also there was Slack hooks which helped to get update in Slack easily, saved us from checking emails and the Jira web\ncons: Dragging and dropping of tickets within sprint boards were sometimes confusing as the selection border did not cover all of the selected items. Sometimes it required to refresh the browser to see reflection of the update in one segment done in another related segment of the UI. Out of the box previews for uploaded MS doc files did not give correct preview of the files all the times.\n",

It allows for seamless saving of information as you type and that's a pretty good feature the user interface is very well laid out and is very easy to navigate through the tool across various screens. Teams across the organisation can view the status of the development items across different projects and across different boards, per developer. JIRA can also be used to track tasks and banwidth allocation for various teams as well. The extension of confluence is the best feature that you could extend to a JIRA instance for your developers\ncons: The amount of integrations that JIRA comes out of the box with can overwhelm new users. It does have a slight steep learning curve, but once the user is comfortable using the system they should be able to navigate through the tool seriously\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Using Jira\npros: I like that Jira makes it easy to manage and see the tasks that are assigned to you through the dashboard, where it displays all of the tasks that you need to do, and through the sprint function where multiple projects can be put on one sprint. On this sprint page it's very easy to adjust what stage a task is in. Along with this the software makes it easy to log time to issues. In the bottom right hand corner there is a play button that you press when you start working on an issue and a stop when you are done. Once hitting the stop button it automatically fills out when you started working on an issue and how much time you spent on it.\ncons: I feel as though the time sheet could be improved a little bit. Currently if you work on a very small amount of issues per time frame that you want the time sheet, it doesn't actually take up that much of the page. For me, I usually work on around 5-7 issues per week, and as such the issues really only take up a small portion of the page. I also feel that if you are assigned to a large amount of projects it can be cumbersome to go and find a specific project if you don't already know the link or haven't worked on it recently. Thankfully this doesn't end up being much of a problem that often, but when it does it is sort of annoying.\n",

When the cycles begin, when they close, the stages and hierarchies that can be built within the same project or task. I consider that for projects that require a great level of detail it is extremely precious and necessary to leave nothing to chance.\ncons: Although I value all the level of detail that can be indicated for a task / project, when simpler tasks are required, follow-ups, daily operation, the little flexibility of the tool becomes totally annoying to ignore some unnecessary parameters. On the other hand, the responsibilities of the tasks always fall on a single member, which can generate an imbalance in the measurement of team performance, as one person is probably left with many more activities than others. What bothers me most from day to day is that on the activity board every time a card is moved to another column (example from \"To Do\" to \"Doing\") the board does not update automatically but it gives you an annoying signal It is not updated and until you refresh the page it will not allow you to move that card or any other, it will continue to show you \"board not updated\", this really makes the tool a little agile for larger teams and with precise and short follow-up meetings.\n",

Raising and keeping track of tickets is easy and intuitive. The integrations allow for updates and resolutions to be tracked without having to use the Jira interface all the time. Also, the possibility of team-specific waterfalling of tasks and requests ensures that Jira is not only suited for one team, but for the collaboration of the entire business.\ncons: Jira is not very novice-friendly, requiring advanced training before having the ability to use it at its full potential. Making changes to existing workflows is also not the easiest as most of the time this will require and administrator intervention - the technical know-how is almost limited to experts only.\n",

With the forced move to using Jira Cloud, my only concern was with uptime and reliability. Though there have been some high-profile issues in the past year, my personal experience has been nothing less than exceptional. That said, you do still run the risk of extended downtime, so have a backup plan to keep things moving for a short period...just in case.\n",

The number of tickets that can be dealt with And because of the ability to integrate and customize it, which is very useful for organizing the affairs of tasks and team members, we can consider it a practical agile methodology that ensures the teamwork excels and achieves its goals. I love Jira's ability to filter missions, which increases our ability to see details of all missions, check the start and end dates as well as team member comments and attachments they've made. All this is done easily without much effort searching. I appreciate the reports that we get and the ease of customizing them to suit our needs, as they include the information that we want to display, especially related to a summary of the workflow during a certain period of time. I love the fact that Jira is easy to customize and integrates with many of the apps we use.\ncons: It's not a bad thing for people who are looking for the right way to manage products and projects, even though Jira looks complicated and members need to put in some time and effort to learn how to use it well. This topic might not be right for everyone, which could hurt the quality of both the inputs and the results.\n",

It's really easy to setup a project, a board, add people, and then customize the swimlanes however the team likes. This is for me a really important feature because even though we all follow agile, not everyone adopts the same principles and methodologies. Teams should be able to adapt the tool to their needs and that's a big step towards success. The reports are also ok, at least for a quick glance at the performance of a certain project (with burndown chart, velocity, etc.). I've also used the API for some automated actions, it works as expected for me.\ncons: Bulk actions are quite hard to do. There are some easy actions (like moving a group of issues to a sprint) but if we try to do something more complex like closing a group of tasks as Done with a certain sub-status (ex. Cancelled, Won't Do, etc.) it's not easy for me at all. Finally, the pricing seems a bit high for smaller teams and starting companies.\n",

It’s a tool that doesn’t just let you keep tabs on a job; it lets you really see it—track each issue, each lead, like it’s right in front of you. The workflows? They’re flexible, like good disguises. You can twist them to fit any shape. Agile boards help keep things under control—like a good stakeout, you get your sprints, your backlogs, keep everyone moving in the right direction. And then there's the integrations… fits with just about anything, like it was built to blend in. Reports and analytics? Those are the real truth-tellers. They don’t lie. They show you who’s keeping up, who’s falling behind. And the automations—well, those let you set things on autopilot. I like that. In my line of work, anything that does some of the heavy lifting for you… it’s a welcome tool. Yeah, Jira’s a good partner, long as you don’t forget who’s in control.\ncons: Jira’s got its ups and downs. It’s a tool that tries to do a little bit of everything, but sometimes that means you’re dealing with too much noise and not enough signal. It can feel bloated, like it’s trying to be the hero of every job, when really, it just needs to get the basics right. Customizing anything? That can take you down a rabbit hole. You end up sifting through layers, settings buried under more settings, just to get it working how you need. Performance is another thing—it’ll drag its feet at the worst times. You want to get in, make a few updates, and get out, but it’s like you’re wading through molasses. And notifications? You’ll get hammered with them unless you shut most off, which kind of defeats the purpose. It’s powerful, sure. But it could use a little more finesse and a lot less complication.\n",

I can post image attachments after submitting the new project, as well as, comments in response to follow-up questions from IT product analysts or developers or product owners. Overall, I am able to document updates to a project and test results for future reference. Finally, I like the fact that, Jira sends me an email update whenever there is a project update or follow-up queries from IT.\ncons: Jira project tracking tool doesn't allow copy-pasting images from Gmail or from clipboard. So, every image which needs to be included in a Jira project, has to be first saved as a file in a folder and then uploaded as an attachment. This additional task of saving an image as a jpg file makes it a time consuming process. Business users who don't have agile or waterfall project management experience in IT, have a tough time adopting Jira. Since Jira isn't integrated with Google suite of tools. it demands additional effort to document and track web analytics projects which amounts to duplicate work.\n",

Being from the Product team at ZS, my team uses a variety of JIRA dashboards including a burndown chart (to monitor if the tasks are progressing smoothly, or whether they are abruptly marked complete at the end of the sprint), and a team progress report, where the number of tasks assigned and completed by each team member is clearly visible. Overall, dashboards help provide a big picture of the sprint status and help monitor sprints effectively.\ncons: The tool is great, but it has certain limitations. The dashboards in JIRA, cannot be downloaded as JPG images when trying to present these to the Leadership team in the form of PPT reports. Many a time, the Snipping tool needs to be used to cut the images from the screen and paste these into the reports which present us with two issues: 1. Low-resolution images which appear blurry when enlarged, and 2. Hassle for opening additional tools to extra the images. It would be helpful if JIRA provides the capability to download the images as JPG, PNG files (or an even better option would be to download the dashboard as a PPT file)\n",

This way, the users feel productive from day one and the organisations do not have to spend money on training (except for freshers).

Although I am not an administrator of this tool, whenever I request some feature, most of the time administrators make them available in minutes simply by some configurations.\ncons: 1.

To get this kind of usefulness, you'd need to get a different Gantt outline application and associate it to Jira through the Atlassian commercial center.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Flexible, powerful, simple to use and grows as you go\npros: Jira is clean and it is simple yet powerful. You can use it for your basic ticket workflows from the get go and expand as you grow or the tasks you wisch to cover branch out. It is easy to customize the ticket views to contain the information you want to use and avoid cluttering. The Workflow editor is one of the most powerful I came across in all my professional career. It might not seem so much of an importance but believe me, when your business grows unexpected necessities will arise and you will suddenly be required to track tasks you never though about. Jira will have you covered and allow you to add different task types which traverse task-type specific phases and have corresponding stati. Also you have all the world of notification and responsibility tracking ping-pong covered as you go. Two further things are woth mentioning: First the Atlassian World (the Wiki Confluence and build system Bamboo and many other products) integrate flawlessly and it actually really makes using them fun. Jira is one of the tools, that make you smile when you are required to use it no matter the task to track, its jus smooth, convenient and above and beyond provides a rich ecosystem for free and commercial plugins even for rather exotic use cases. Also, the license Model behind it scales fantastically. When we introduced it we were a small company with 8 people (we are now going strong towards the 200) and it was critical to keep cost for our tools reasonable. Jira got us covered.\ncons: When we scaled, the License was not as flexible in higher user tiers as it was in the lower ones. Also once upon a time an update went wrong and we had to invest a bucketload of time and brain power to get everything back up to speed. We did run jira on premise and hat some custom plugins so there might be some of the tripwires: In case you use plugins they must be available in the version you wish to upgrade to and this might require some research prior to updates. Also, you can make a science out of the workflow and notification configuration. In case it is not documented well when you do it it might get you into trouble.\n",

One of its key strengths is its flexibility and customization options. With Jira Software, users can create custom workflows, issue types, and fields, allowing them to tailor the tool to their specific needs and processes. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity, as well as better project outcomes.Another major advantage of Jira Software is its robust reporting and analytics capabilities. The tool provides a wide range of built-in reports and dashboards, which can be customized to display the data and metrics that are most relevant to the team or project. This can help teams identify areas for improvement, track progress towards goals, and make data-driven decisions.Jira Software also supports Agile methodologies, making it an ideal tool for software development teams that follow Agile practices such as Scrum or Kanban. The tool includes features such as backlog management, sprint planning, and burndown charts, which can help Agile teams stay organized and focused on delivering value to customers.\ncons: it can be complex and difficult to use, particularly for teams that are not already familiar with Agile methodologies or project management best practices. This can lead to a steep learning curve and require significant investment in training and support.\n",

So, all these cases can be handled perfectly. 3) It helps in tracking the status of each CPI ticket and allows me to put comments to ask any clarifying questions. We can also assign any participants if we need help from other engineers.\ncons: I don't have much to dislike about JIRA but one thing which I feel can be improved is its user interface. I understand that because of having a rich feature base, it is quite complex but if the user interface is somewhat simplified, it will help quite a lot of new engineers or users who are assigned CPI cases on JIRA.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Thoughts on JIRA from a non-programmer: Still easy to use\npros: I am a technical writer who used JIRA as my first introduction into working in a close-knit, agile programming environment. I really appreciated the clean design, multiple ways to accomplish tasks, and logical visual representations of concepts. Is something assigned to you? It has your face on it. We had several development teams working in tandem and JIRA allowed for each team to structure their sprints according to their own preferences (some had more traditional set up and others used kanban). As time went on we were able to add more projects to JIRA, after transitioning off of ClearQuest for our baseline fixes, and while there is certainly a learning curve getting established programmers who have used one system of tracking for 10+ years converted to using JIRA, most everyone was able to transition and feel comfortable within a few weeks. Speaking as a non-programmer, I found JIRA to be incredibly useful and easy. Tracking writing and editing projects through development didn't require any specific setup or features and it was all around a great tool.\ncons: While it was great that every project could be tracked from our one JIRA site for my relatively small (30ish people) development team, any time fields needed to be added for one specific team to track something for stories or bugs, it was there for everyone. This led to having rather cluttered add screens that meant for a good deal of scrolling. I know some of this was surely user error, but having a bit more control would be nice. Also, the search function occasionally would just... not work. At all. As adorable as the sad faced little magnifying glass was when this happened, it would be very frustrating to lose functionality without warning. Being browser-based always makes for risk and some days would just be constant checking of if JIRA was up again so untracked progress didn't fall through the cracks.\n",

I've been using it for most of the past 12 years. It is highly customizable and can be as light or as heavy of a burden on your employees as you want. For the most part, it stays out of your way of getting work done. If you can get your developers to update their tickets appropriately, it will generate a lot of nice reports for managers that can be used for future planning and to see how teams are doing. If you are a medium sized organization (more than a couple projects and/or dev teams) you probably want to have someone who's job it is to manage tickets in Jira: triaging bugs, making sure feature tickets are actionable, that tickets have the correct information, that they get updated appropriately, etc.\ncons: Like a lot of project management tools like this, you can get too much information. There almost needs to be a developer view, a tester view, and a manager view of a ticket. There are sooo many fields on a ticket and each role cares about a different subset of them. You kind of learn over time which ones you need to pay attention to in each role.\n",

You can customize almost every aspect of your Cloud instance, Project, Boards, & Workflows to fit nearly any use case, and across multiple departments. Permissions to your Jira instance can be restricted at a very granular level if need-be, but can be more broad if the occasion calls for it. Additionally, and probably the largest reason we transitioned from enterprise Jira to a Cloud Jira instance is the pervasive availability of integration across the market. Speaking of market - Jira has a growing 3rd-party market that offers enhancements to the Jira platform that Jira does not natively provide or are too complex for an untrained Jira administrator to script themselves. Of those that are \"approved\" by Jira, we are extremely happy with the breadth of functionality, integration and ease of use. With all that I do have to say that our favorite thing with all project leads is Jira Automation. Once you understand the \"SmartValues\" language that automation runs on, the use cases for automation are truly endless. It is one of the many strong features from a project management perspective.\ncons: Jira takes a village. Atlassian has an incredible resources in the \"Atlassian Community\" and they do a great job of having experienced users there to answer questions but, because each instance can be set up so differently, the actual customer support request portal is limited to bug fixes. As a result, much of my time administering Jira is spent researching how to fix a roadblock or how to modify permissions - a lot of \"learning by doing\". Generally speaking, Jira can be difficult to use from an administration perspective, *but* for the purposes of moving ticket along, the UX is pretty good and the UI is fairly intuitive.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Great for time tracking and task management, but some functionality is overly complicated.\npros: I love the KabBan task view, our company uses this every morning for a company-wide standup meeting. We have set up a customized board with cards that display budget/due date/time spent/etc. and it has been invaluable to us during COVID-19, as we are all working from home and need to stay connected. Jira's time logging via Tempo has some buggy elements, but has been absolutely crucial in maintaining a clear view of task progress and budget maintenance. The time logging tools are incredibly reliable and allow the perfect amount of editing control by both administrators and users.\ncons: It is a big pain not being able to assign more than one user to an issue at a time, especially when making Jira issues for meetings, as the purpose here is to provide an issue to log time against. It has also been difficult for our company to systematize and homogenize project structure, as there was such a large learning curve to Jira project setup, and we have a large number of open projects. The functionality between projects differs greatly, and I think a large part of this is due to complicated project setup and maintenance. While Jira is very developer-minded, and many of our developers like it, it seems a slightly less appropriate fit for our designers/strategists and project management team. I also lack the ability to export some reports I need, for example a clear Estimates versus Actuals report in CSV form.\n",

The charts of Scrum and Kanban board also tend to fly away making it hard to understand and sometimes adds in extra effort for the managers or scrum masters.\n",

Some of their support staff are great at asking clarifying questions and quickly working to a resolution but more often than not, their support staff may not fully understand the scope of the issue and will offer half-baked solutions that leave me as a user feeling misunderstood and frustrated. I may not have the vocabulary to convey in \"Jira\" terms what I need, but they as support agents should be able to bridge that gap. A simple conversation over the phone would help address this as a series of clarifying questions could easily help use come to a consensus but with emails going back and forth, it can create a time-consuming and extremely frustrating support situation. The setup and configuration process could be streamlined and made more intuitive. Because its so customizable, it makes sense that it will take some work to get it setup properly, but for simple user cases like ours, it really should be an easier process.\n",

We fill requirements documents on Confluence which integrated with Jira. It is great tool for task and issue management across teams in different departments or domains. Also we integrated Jira with BitBucket. So, when a new release is ready, we get last commit from BitBucket on Jira. This is another powerful feature of Jira. All Atlassian products can be integrate with Jira easily.\ncons: Jira is not an easy to use platform. Training is must to learn how to use Jira.

My team and I used Jira for Project management and defect tracking. I customized the defect state lifecycle as per our project requirements which I find a handy feature. Using Jira, you can also write test cases and run workflow before software release as part of build acceptance testing. You can also generate test reports, export defects and create test workflows and use many other advanced features using Jira software.\ncons: When I was executing test cases, the user interfaces for running the test case and updating the status of the test case were confusing. For running test cases, The XRay Jira provides a tabular structure, and if there are too many columns in the table, you have horizontally scroll to find the \"Play\" button to run the test case. I think this user interface can be simplified and made more user-friendly.\n",

This flexibility helps me to avoid confusions, and improve my productivity.Furthermore, Jira integrates with more than a thousand third-party tools, such as GitHub and Slack. This integration capability is very important because it facilitates cross-functional communications.Jira's reporting features are very essential. It allows me to monitor my progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions. The reports can be customized and exported in various formats.Jira helps me to prioritize work, and deliver value faster. I totally recommend project managers and company employees to use Jira at work. It helps you be more productive at work.\ncons: In my opinion, there are no cons for Jira. The only thing I can mention is that the software can be overwhelming for new users due to its rich features and complex interface. It requires some training and patience to fully utilize its capabilities. However, I do not consider this as a dislike. It is a faily user-frienly software. I enjoy using Jira at work!\n",

We were using another service desk software but noticed that Jira Service Desk could offer all the features we needed, and all for free! Or so we thought! The plan we chose is for small teams (which we are) and is advertised (still to this date) as \"Always free for 3 agents\". \"Free\" is further highlighted at the top of the Plans & Pricing page and a large \"$0\" is displayed. Well, it took some time to get it set up and to import our tickets (this is not easy and we needed support which was quite difficult to get). Once we got set up, it took some time to learn about it (no phone support on free plan!) and we devoted many hours to this. And all was well for about 2-3 months......then we receive an email to say that payment is due! And that our account would be cancelled if we don't pay! What? We contacted Jira, only to be told that we are on a temporary free plan, like a free trial, and that payment is due after 3 months I believe it was. We explained about the \"free\" plan that we signed up to but the Jira support member just reiterated her point and was quote blunt and unhelpful. We went back to check out the \"Plans and Pricing\" table on the Atlassian website, thinking we obviously missed the small print. But we didn't!!! They were still brazenly advertising \"$0\" and \"Always free for 3 agents\" and there is no mention of a free trial , anywhere on this page at all!!\n",

It can be customized to your preferred method of operation, which makes it very malleable to your specific business model. There are also a number of great add-ons and integrations that can loop many of your essential software licenses together, which helps instill uniformity and precision.\ncons: JIRA can be very complicated to use. The problem with having a software that is this customizable is that your options are seemingly endless. Unfortunately, there is no real \"instruction manual\" for the software, and I find that the online wiki is often several versions out of date, which makes troubleshooting extremely difficult. In addition, it's very difficult to track down a customer service representative for assistance. In fact, at this point, I'm not ever sure how to.\n",

Whichever option you will choose you are covered! With its extensible platform through plugins you will never get tired of Jira. The installation is pretty much straightforward and with latest versions you can also make it HA, for instance on AWS, quite easily.\ncons: Although the product is very mature, feels also like a big giant monolith although its plugin architecture. Also, plugins are too much expensive for just simple features. There should be much control from the Atlassian Marketplace, which should follow more an App Store logic like Apple's or Google's one.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Perfect Combination of Customizable, Detail-Oriented, and Easy to Use\npros: I love JIRA. I use it professionally and personally. Even though it is primarily a task manager for software development, I have found that it is flexible enough to be used for all sorts of projects. It is amazing how customizable it is; you can configure your project settings to your already existing workflow, whatever it may be. While the initial setup can be time consuming, once you have your settings configured, using the tool is a breeze. It takes seconds to create tasks, start springs, evaluate progress, etc. I find that this makes JIRA standout from other task managers. In most cases, if the software allows for detail-oriented task management the process of inputting and tracking the tasks themselves is cumbersome. Entering and tracking tasks should not have to be another time-consuming task! The JIRA web application is also excellent, making it easy to enter or track tasks on-the-go.\ncons: I think there is a lot of potential with Jira's NextGen projects, however, the software rollout has been uneven and often not well documented. I wish this process would have been better thought out to make transitioning to NextGen projects smoother.\n",

Everything is laid out visually, so it's easy to see where each task is in the pipeline - no more wondering if something is stuck or forgotten. This keeps everyone on the team on the same page and helps us avoid bottlenecks. Plus, for us Agile folks, Jira just fits. Sprints, user stories, backlogs - it all integrates seamlessly. Prioritizing tasks within each sprint cycle is a breeze, and tracking progress feels smooth.\ncons: Now, let's talk about the learning curve. When I first started with Jira, it felt like there was a whole new language to learn. Between the interface and all the project management jargon, it took some time to get comfortable. For new team members, especially those without experience with project management software, this can be a bit of a hurdle. There's also the whole customization thing. Don't get me wrong, the ability to tailor Jira to your specific needs is great. But if you go overboard, things can get messy fast. Overly complex workflows just make it harder for everyone to navigate the system and keep things on track.\n",

It assists me with dealing with the undertakings and follows side by side of the jobs being finished. The product is very simple to know and hence the wealth of clear how-to recordings is incredible.\ncons: Estimating has gotten truly wild as of late. it had been once extraordinary worth however since they should be cornered a major market fragment they're truly draining it for all its value, Jira like most programming highlights a tad of an expectation to learn and adapt.\n",

Multiple users can get involved within the platform and have different subtasks assigned to them. Having the possibility to create workflows keep things simple and easy to see what's the current status of the whole task at a glance. The platform allows for customisation as well, this comes really handy as no project is identical and you may need to add some automations to the process to meet your specific needs. Thanks to their recent Boards implementation, you can see the next tasks that need to be worked on and as well as what's already been done and what's in progress.\ncons: The platform might be a bit overwhelming when you start working with it for the first time. It's hard to know all the possible functionalities until you have worked with it for a while. Although it's possible to customise, some parts can get a bit tricky to perform if you don't have the knowledge. On the other side, you can also reach out to them if you need help. In terms of pricing, it can get a bit expensive if you need a lot of users.\n",

It allows us to accurately track to our L&D deliverables related to the SCRUM’s JIRA stories, as they may change over the course of a sprint.\ncons: Sometimes you have to download a mock up instead of it opening directly in Windows viewer, not a big deal but just an extra step; JIRA is a much more technical application, it definitely requires a learning curve to use it, it’s not a super simple interface.\n",

It is mainly adopted by teams following the agile methodology. The overall usability and user experience are unbelievable and the smoothness through which we can switch between different sections of the platform makes it a very usable product. It helps to create Scrum and Kanban projects as well as create and manage tasks, user stories, etc. by these teams. Developers can easily use GIT or TFS to check-in or commit data on the respective servers whereas testers can file relevant bugs or issues encountered for the relevant tasks under a User story. Overall, this is a great project management tool to use.\ncons: As compared to other platforms like Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services), this tool doesn't provide much more features and support for functionalities. Anyone would prefer to use Azure DevOps as it is a complete DevOps solution as well as a Project management tool with decent pricing for corporates and also free pricing for a team of 5.\n",

Sure you can figure it out, but it will require a lot of facepalms. It's good for larger organizations with several cross-functional teams, but if you are a smaller organization stick with Trello and checklists for the cards if sub-tasks are needed. The sub-tasks in Jira are just plain awful to work with, and will end up wasting a lot of time for your team.\n",

We have been working for almost 3 years now and the user experience it offers is applaudable. You can create your agile boards for scrums and can go KANBAN as well. You can create as many different teams and squads. Link your issues to stories and trace it to the feature, Track how much effort is being spent on an item; Track for how long an item has been been sitting idle; Prioritize your issues, backlogs; Create dashboards for ease and convenience; generate reports, traceability matrix, velocity burndown charts; add/remove user access. You can customize it as per requirement and with ease. Recently it has moved to cloud, so down time has been relevantly decreased which is an added bonus. Best part I like about using JIRA is that its very easy to handle, we can do bulk update on items and it takes very less time to understand. This is one of the best tools that is out there and I believe almost every organization is using it.\ncons: There is nothing much to add in this section. Practically I am all thumbs up for JIRA. I have a suggestion though. JIRA needs to have a Instant Messaging option enabled so that an organizations do not need to look out for a separate tool. I think if Atlassian would be able to achieve it, not only they would be able to enhance their customer base but they would be able bring a lot revenue.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: The \"Ticket or No Ticket\" Debate\npros: The best part about JIRA is the ability to keep track of all work being done via tickets. I love that JIRA works for all kinds of styles of work. We work within an Agile environment, with some teams using Scrum and other teams using Kanban. No matter how the team is structured, they utilize JIRA tickets. This is great because there is a single repository for all work being done and we can easily search for tickets across all the different teams. The use of Epics vs. Stories is very easy too. We can keep track of what tickets belong to which effort with ease and show the progress of work through the tickets. We can also easily maintain a backlog of tickets. If two separate people submit a similar ticket (or at least two tickets that reference the same work effort), we can combine those tickets easily so that we aren't feeling overwhelmed with more tickets than actual work.\ncons: The biggest debate among our team members is when it is necessary to create a ticket. JIRA has created a culture of needing to log every little thing, even if it takes just a moment to complete the work. Sometimes, it takes longer to create the ticket than to complete the task at hand. That tells me there is too much reliance on JIRA to report work completed. It causes some in management to show that their department is succeeding simply by the number of tickets completed. But the tickets don't tell the whole story, especially because there isn't a time component to those tickets being completed.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: JIRA - The monolith everyone uses\npros: JIRA is an industry standard tool, due to this it's very well known and a colloquial metaphor for \"tickets\" in and of itself. JIRA is able to handle monolithic projects and the many related projects with regard to them. JIRA is very good at allowing and automatically building self-referencing tickets within it's comments and ticket parts, if you put a ticket title into a ticket it will automatically reference the actual ticket with a link. It is also very good at adding to existing tickets with related tasks, sub-tasks, and prioritization. JIRA also is considered in almost every third party tool with a massive volume of software that offers \"JIRA plugins\" considering it's high stature with the IT community.\ncons: JIRA is \"the tool\" but it's not \"a good tool\" for every project and company size. JIRA is like other commercial grade products that just aren't designed for simple day to day use. While it opens up nicely and begins to make tons of sense in larger projects, larger organizations, and larger teams it often doesn't show the same beauty with simple projects and day to day ticket tracking. Additionally, the JQL language is ridiculous follows in the foot steps of many other proprietary languages that are only great for constant users of JIRA. While that's the implied scenario because as mentioned JIRA is \"the tool\" it's not always the case. When my day is split 20 ways, I have little time to sit down and do more than plug in a JIRA ticket number to get to the issue to investigate, review, get sign off on a fix, and apply. JIRA is also having what appears to be a lot of difficulties this year staying online with their new data center providers. I don't remember ever having these issues prior to their most recent move.\n",

This might result in unnecessarily long delays when external users want immediate input or participation. 2) When many boards exist within a project, statuses (user stories) cannot be established explicitly for each board. 3) User stories may be assigned to just two categories of users: assignees and reporters. JIRA does not permit the assignment of numerous assignees to a single user story.\n",

The ticket feature is also very interesting and it works very good.\ncons: The platform is that powerful that at the beginning it can overwhelm you, a short introduction or training I think is needed.

There are a whole lot of places to enter data, which ends up being a bit of a downfall. When JIRA is set up well, it does support PM. When it is used as a vanilla Agile product, I think it falls behind other offerings.\ncons: JIRA has so many configuration points that it takes forever to get it working properly for your team. They have also been changing the UI a lot recently, which has obscured where some data is, which - predictably - has slowed down our use. If JIRA could get a more consistent UI, I feel it could be a much better product.\n",

It's come a long ways in this span in terms of advanced functionality and additional configurable content, and it's consistently proven itself as a market leader in project and task management services. JIRA reporting, dashboard, task tracking, and project development activities are comprehensively impressively designed, easy to use, and highly collaborative for internal teams.\ncons: The success an end user will yield from the software is highly dependent on it being configured in a manner that aligns with the business needs of the customer organization. For example, I've experienced instances where there are growing pains in how internal teams learn to standardize the way they tag tickets for project and task tracking and then use these identifiers to develop reports, create dashboards, and track schedules. If not setup properly by System Administrators then the ROI will be delayed, making it essential for teams to be properly educated and trained on the system. JIRA provides a wealth of content for training & education but worth noting the difficulty an organization can face if not approached strategically and with strong design plans during the discovery phase of implementation.\n",

Prioritization - Very Easy to classify certain types of Tickets raised through Jira if they are Critical, Medium or low priority. Definitely helps to Manage on what issues need to be looked at urgently and Manage the tickets so they get completed on time. 2. Editing/Updating Features - Very easy to update the fields in the Tickets if there is an error. A thoughtful feature. Even allows to update the people who log the tickets on the progress. 3. Easy to Use - Very user friendly. When I was first introduced to the software I was skeptical on how to use it but after 1 day it was very very easy. Did not face any issues and always kept whatever was assigned to me up to date and ensured they got completed on Time.4. Collaboration - Makes it very easy to Collab with colleagues if your working on something and need their views or expertise.\ncons: I have not faced much challenges when using Jira, but some additional things that can be improved are: 1. Issue Type - There should be a better issue type system that could come in Place. There are some issues which come up but the issue types which are available make it confusing on which type of issue to assign it as.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Made a notable impact on the way we report, manage and track bugs to resolution\npros: We've been using Jira Software for the past few months. First of all, it's pretty good tool for tracking and managing tasks, but there are a few things that could be improved. One thing I really like about Jira is the ability to create detailed tasks and sub-tasks. It helps in breaking down our monthly goals and KPIs into manageable pieces. This makes it easier to track progress, assignments and stay updated on the overall completion stats. Everyone has visibility into what they need to do and when. . It can be frustrating when you're in a hurry and the page takes forever to load. I've heard from some colleagues that this is a common issue, so I hope they improve the performance soon. The integration with other tools is great. We use Slack and Intercom, and the way Jira connects with these tools is really convenient. It makes communication much smoother.\ncons: I found the interface to be a bit overwhelming at first. There's so many features and options that it was confusing for me at times. It took me a while to get the hang of it, and I had to read up docs (which were not so easy to understand) on how to use the Jira automation feature. Maybe it would be better if they simplified the layout a bit. Another thing that I found annoying is the speed. Sometimes, Jira can be really slow, especially when you're dealing with large projects like ours.\n",

Sería genial pudieran encontrar un método para poder exportar esa base de datos de manera más sencilla y con un diseño de fácil acceso visual y de esa manera poder filtrar los datos.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: The Gold Standard for Issue Tracking\npros: JIRA feels like the gold standard for ticketing software, and for good reason. It has a long history, and lots of buy-in throughout multiple industries. It helps to keep individuals and teams organized, plan out resourcing, and provides an easy to access historical record of bugs/issues/projects.\ncons: One thing that's often difficult is the ability to create recurring tickets for issues/projects that occur on a regular cadence. You can clone existing tickets which works, but it's not exactly efficient. There's also a bit of a general learning curve - creative views and dashboards is possible, but it's not as intuitive as some of the drag-and-drop competitors that are popping up.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: JIRA provides essential tools for creating, tracking, and deployment new applications!\npros: I like that most of the features of JIRA are quite intuitive. When I started using JIRA as a tech support specialist, I was able to easily utilize everything I needed to create bug tickets without needing specialized training. As a project manager now, I have had to review more detailed documentation to use the more complex features and tools, but application development is quite complex in itself so that's definitely understandable and expected.\ncons: The thing I like the least with JIRA is that when you're managing tickets within sprints or backlogs, some features are only available within one specific view. For example, you can't clone a ticket within the backlog view, you have to open the individual ticket for the cloning option to appear. It's hard to remember which options are available within a specific view. I'd like JIRA better if options were more universal but I do understand why certain operations are limited to certain views.\n",

As a team taking on Agile methodology in an enterprise where is was a very new concept, we needed a tool that was easy to learn, intuitive to manage and one that provided integration with extensions for our Agile ceremonies. Jira provided all of these things at an affordable price that has kept us working at a large scale enterprise level for many years. Navigation is simple, intuitive and while there is a small learning curve, most of our new team members have been able to pick up on things within the first few months. As our team's ScrumMaster and Product Owner, I enjoy using this tool to manage sprints and stories and generally never have to wrestle with the tool to make it do what I want it to do.\ncons: The only drawback I have had with this tool is that sometime extension/plugin management can be a pain, wherein it is tough to locate what you have overall and how it is costing you. We've also had issues with duplicate versions of the same extension/plugin that led us to Jira support, which does leave a bit to be desired as it took a while to arrive at a resolution.\n",

As a result, all task-related processes can be created and tracked at the granular level. Workflow functions, as well as the concept of roles and rights, help with task management and ensure that the process runs smoothly. Jira can be integrated with any team tool, making it your primary source of information. The advantage stems from the documentation produced, which is primarily used for task distribution, management, and tracking. Time can be tracked and accounted for, as can projects. Everyone keeps a time log and records their questions, answers, workarounds, and other details.\ncons: Sometimes it is difficult to see the full complexity of a solution, which is all possible. Furthermore, because the results are frequently irrelevant, an optimized search would be advantageous. It took a lot of AddOns to make it \"round.\" Costs should not be overlooked.

The user interface or visual interface is very user friendly in a sense that the options/buttons/tabs for executing an action are easy to find. For example the \"create\" button for submitting a ticket is highlighted on the upper part of the interface. I also love the option of setting the prioritization level of concern, that way the department who will handle the concern can easily determine if the ticket needs an immidiate action. I also wanted to highlight the feature where we can receive real time to time notification via email from the moment that the ticket is assigned up to when the ticket has been taken care of.\ncons: Its just that Jira is a bit hard to setup at first and there is no actual messaging ferature within. But once setup is complete, everything is good to go. Also the communication feature has been compensated by the option to respond on the comment section of ticket.\n",

It has many useful fe­atures that provide teams with a comple­te system for planning and completing tasks in a fle­xible work setting.

There is a steep learning process, and the abundant choices may lead to puzzlement and an inconvenient experience, particularly for smaller groups or easier projects.

Like if you have a project or board with a lot of issue/tickets, it's takes a lot of times to load, or performing actions on it can feel sluggish, not work or just bug itself. Another thing, that they have greatly improved with the recent re-designs, it's how hidden some features were under a menu (...) menu, when before there was a dedicated button for such important features (moving issues, closing etc). Now, they've changed it but I don't know why they made the change to begin with.\n",

Better use a online tool for that.\n",

It has everything you need for running projects using Scrum, Kanban or other frameworks. It also has a decent support ticketing module.\ncons: The major problem with Jira is its 'flexibility', i.e. it actually encourages you to customise it. If you want a tool that enables you to run Scrum/Kanban/XP out of the box and doesn't need loads of configuration, there are cheaper options that are much easier to adopt and maintain. Jira is *very* complicated to set up and administer, due mainly to its legacy of always having been a 'customisable' platform. Worst of all, the project creation flow actually distracts you away from using templates set up by the admin, and when someone does this it's a lot of work to recover.\n",

It's very powerful for advanced users as well with custom queries and ability to customize the ticket's fields, Sprint Board and ticket lifecycle.\ncons: Ticket vs. Story vs. Sub-ticket - The distinction isn't really clear on when you should really use each of them. It is often confusing for people and leads to mistakes. Your personal experience with Jira would vary heavily based of your project's administrator's decisions to configure the ticket lifecycle, custom fields, JIra board appearance and so on. As a user that is not an administrator you can't tweak or create a personal view of Jira that is convenient for you, so often you rely on your administrator's judgment of what is good for the company/project. Since each Jira project can have different settings, it is often painful to re-assign a ticket between projects as they require different type of fields which sometime you don't have the right context to know what they mean in a big organization. Each custom field should have a hint to explain what it means and provide an example. Each project/component should have a default assignee to triage the ticket if you don't know to whom you should assign it.\n",

With the growing number of companies and projects following an agile software development approach to reduce cost and have an early iterative prototype for customer demos, JIRA works great at tracking bi-weekly scrum cycles and daily stand-ups for ensuring the project stays on schedule.\ncons: What I like least about JIRA the representation of dependency view between created tickets on the board view, or also known as the swim-lanes view in some cases. When adding a dependency between one ticket to another, JIRA creates a whole new row for the dependent tickets on the header of other tickets which has a separation effect that may cause one to forget about the top row of dependent tickets. I prefer to have all the tickets together in a single-multicolumn board instead of \"two separate boards\" on a single page.\n",

As someone who still learned the classic \"waterfall\" in my studies, Jira was an eye-opener on how to approach it differently and still achieve meaningful and sometimes even better and faster results. It is well adapted to a more agile work process, you can map the main part of the work that actually occurs in it. For conceptual preparatory work, however, I would recommend a connection with Confluence and/or Trello, where one devotes oneself more to the \"big picture\" and comprehensive functions in their entirety, while in Jira one then plans, accompanies and works through the concrete step-by-step implementation.\ncons: The notification mechanism in JIRA, as in almost all Atlassian products, has never really been thought through. All notifications still work via email. With several projects, this can easily lead to a flooding of the email inbox.

It is adaptable as well - I have a client who uses it for keeping track of writing assignments. All details regarding the issue are kept on a single page, which is extremely helpful if you are assigned to the issue. What's more, you can set it to send notifications in case there are updates to the issue page. Chances of you missing updates are, therefore, practically nil. You can also set the issues page to follow your own custom workflow. The GUI is so easy-to-use that I don't even have to read the manual/documentation to know how the update an issues page the first time I used the software.\ncons: I'm hard-pressed naming a con for this software - there's practically none. I've used other issue tracking softwares, but this is practically the best among the lot.\n",

Moreover, all the different departments are compatible with this tool and can help each other and track wach others progress which help ultimately help to plan their schedule in the future. We also noted that it can be expanded with various plugins and the available plugins and extentions are in THOUSANDS! Even you will find most popular applications are available for contributing to the tool.\ncons: We are new to tool but still many of our developers and marketing teams had difficulty while interacting with the tool. Personally using this tool also made me realise that UI is more focused for technical people and is difficult for regular user. Progress tracking coukd have been better if the cloud storage was more. They literally expect you to upload files near about 15mbs. Actually we are paying for the tool but still it does not allow us to make an offline copy of the reports. It would be better if atleast we can download, even with some less specifications for our clients to show them progress but that feature is long awaited.\n",

Another thing that I like is the dashboard. It’s simple and it’s great if you want to monitor something. The best thing about JIRA is that it allows people to use their tools and templates which most of the software companies don’t allow. Plus you can use it for basic workflows tickets and it’s easy to customize the views of the ticket to have the information that you want.\ncons: What I don’t like is that sometimes you can’t close out the ticket if you are not the creator. To close the ticket, you need to create one. That can be a little frustrating. Another thing is the price. I feel like you pay more for upgrading every time than you paid for the first time. Furthermore, they have a complex layout which means that sometimes it’s hard to find something that you are searching for. It just takes away too much of your time.

As a user, it's easy to use for the most part. Besides having the option of hosting the application in-house, it also has the Cloud edition so from the Systems Team perspective, there's no need for servers, backups, security, keeping the service up (with fault tolerance), etc.\ncons: From the administration aspect of the software, JIRA still has a long way to go: 1) As an administrator, as far as I can see, one can *not* even do such a simple thing as change the Display Name for a user (I suppose it's a \"feature\" but I can't see why that's a good feature). Instead, an invite is sent out to the user, who can then set the Display Name after signing up. 2) As an administrator, one can login as another user to test permissions. That's normally a nice functionality for administrators. However, for some functionalities, while you are still logged in as another user, you suddenly go back to your normal identity. That's very confusing and thwarts the purpose. One potential good use is being able to login as another user to set/update the Display Name (see #1). 3) Setting permissions is not that easy. I tried to set permissions for an account that's used for scripting (using the REST API) but it seems very difficult (really, it should be easy) to get the permissions done correctly -- sufficient but minimal privileges. 4) The REST API is not great. The online documentation is often outdated and sometimes things don't work (with errors). Even when things run without errors, it might not actually do the thing that it's supposed to do (so you write the code for nothing when you expect it to work).\n",

Things like completing a sprint and starting a new one can often be harder than they sound because of things like stories/tickets still being in progress.

It also has the possibility of sharing information through files of different length (.txt, .pdf, word, .mp4, among others) in order to provide greater ease of understanding to the person responsible for carrying out the informed task. In addition, this tool offers precise search filters, saving time in the handling of the interface to focus on what the user wants to obtain.\ncons: 1- The synchronization time of Git with Jira slows down with some internet connections, limiting the use of the benefits of this tool in some users. 2- The user has a lot of freedom to make changes in all the modules of the tasks. Although notification of the change should be a hierarchy of charges to perform them.\n",

Our Product Management team lives out of Jira for our day-to-day task management, and we work in a 2-week Scrum style. We use Confluence for our documentation and product requirement documents, then Jira Product Discovery for road mapping, prioritization and idea tracking. All products in the Atlassian ecosystem work seamlessly together. Jira gets a lot of hate for being complicated and hard to implement, but like many things, its biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. I love Jira because its flexibility means it's a tool that our whole company uses, from Development to Customer Support to Product Management. This makes it easy to collaborate with other teams, without having to jump between and learn other platforms. Having a couple of people in the company who know Jira inside out mitigates any implementation challenges some may complain about.\ncons: I despise that Jira third-party tools/addons are billed by the number of active Jira users you have. This means that if you want to use an addon for a small team of 5 users, but you have 100 Jira users, you have to pay for 100 licenses. This billing model makes no sense and means it is financially not feasible to use most addons, which our teams could greatly benefit from using\n",

It's relatively easy to create workflows that aren't intuitive, or worse, leave users in \"dead end\" states that require admin assistance.

It has lots of nice features that we use such as to link issues to one another, link tickets, put labels of versions to be released, link to pull requests on Git Hub and scale priority and story points.

My entire company uses JIRA across different boards and when you want to contact a team in specific it's easy to just open a ticket or link it to another.

It is very easy to set time duration and align resources, manage users for each tasks or multiple work. Different teams and department can use it with their own schedule or work of flow. Interaction of Jira with other software is easily managed.\ncons: Documentation or help is bit tricky some times. Not very easy for novice but once you are on it then very easy to operate and manage.

But though it is large, it is also relatively simple to being with and can accommodate simple workflows even for smaller teams, with some neat ready-to-go templates. But its abiity to grow into a platform that can support a large corporation is amazing. Scalability is definitely their main power. Jira also bennefits from a very large marketplace of plugins that can bring more functionality and fit the granular specificities of each company or project. It also has a very cheap pricing for smaller teams.\ncons: Some basic functionality if just not there, which is rather unbelievable considering the size of this tool. For example easily planning a sprint, doing capacity tracking or even moving or changing issues can be very difficult and you may need to resort to plugins in their marketplace (with their own pricing). Some of the more advanced functionality (like workflows) is a bit complex and confusing and requires quite a bit of studying. Their pricing after the first tier (for startups) is just unbelievably expensive. It's a jump from $10 to $1000 when you add your 11th team member. Because of this we will sadly not keep using the software after that threshold.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Good features let down by a difficult hard to use UX\npros: We moved to JIRA from Visual Studio online because it supported Kanban better than Visual Studio Online at the time. On the plus side, it integrates brilliantly with Slack our team communication tool of choice. You can tag stories, create reports and link to tasks easily and very efficiently with the tags displaying in Slack conversations as JIRA links. Working with Visual Studio Git we tag all of our stories with the JIRA story numbers and they link together very efficiently. Confluence is included which is a Sharepoint equivalent. This allows you to create knowledge bases of information about your projects which you can use to document your product. You can easily embed reports into this using tags or the query tools. There are a great set of features and this tool integrates well with other systems\ncons: The UX changes on a fairly frequent basis and from experience not in a good way. It is still quite difficult after a year of using it to remember where things are because the controls are not as intuitive as they should be. There are a number of bugs with how the UI displays (particularly in swimlane kanban mode) and although it has fault reporting options, you don't feel that any changes you suggest or bugs you report are used. Confluence often feels like a poor persons version of sharepoint (which is not a recommendation) as it feels clunky creating pages, sections or defining navigation. The query tools are a bit like sql and partially fill in with suggestions but can be fiddly for the BA to create. This is a tool I would really like to recommend given how trendy it is but sadly after a year using I can't because whilst it's features are excellent it lacks ease of use.\n",

It is highly customizable and easy to implement; we migrated our current process from Pivotal Tracker to Jira with relative ease. In comparison to other similar products I have used in the past, it exceeds the competition in flexibility, integration opportunities, ease of use and implementation, as well as configurability.\ncons: I find myself running into minor bug-type issues somewhat regularly; like being unable to imbed an image in an item description at creation and only being able to do so in the edit view. Also have experienced issues with multiple users editing the same item and saving over one another's changes. Only issues have been minor that we've learned to work around.\n",

It is a very powerful and collaborative PM tool which supported my PM role in an Agile context. (I was on a standard/waterfall project methodology for years... Agile is rather new to me) It is highly configurable, meant to suit any niche, industry, or user scenario by combining the powers of Kanban and Scrum. You can set up just about any of your workflows, project states, fields, action/issue items, etc, via the default settings (that surprisingly some have worked out of the box), or by easy customization on demand. Data analysis is easy as well. JIRA collects from all data points you set up into a single data hub that is extractable, searchable, and comprehensive (with all your historical data). The core program and its APIs are pretty mature and with proper documentation. Our devs didn't really have a hard time since they were provided with a rich toolkit to begin with. JIRA also comes with its mobile app so that you can manage your projects on-the-go. It is cloud-based via subscription which relieves the admins from the difficult part of infra and server setup. I have not experienced any downtime as of my 1 year use of this service.\ncons: It is cloud-based so you have to make sure you have enough bandwidth provisions to support this (rather challenging for bigger teams working on the same location at the same time). The usual loading times may take longer with poor connectivity. A rather steep price for small businesses to use. Self-hosting JIRA will also make things more expensive (and risky) as the number of users grow.\n",

Now, tickets can be easily assigned and tracked and the work can be done effortessly with Jira. It has tons and tons of functionalities avaibale such as tagging tickets and due date/ expiration. These values can also be utilised in analysis module for reporting.\ncons: There are no major cons for Jira. Atlassian has provided a very exhaustive documentation for Jira which is available online on their website. One can simply head over to the online documentation/ FAQs and resolve most of their problems. If not, their customer support service is also great and answers back quickly. Also, a wide online community is available to support Jira, therefore, anyone new won't face much problems.\n",

It is difficult to navigate or track the original ticket in an Active sprint view. As an alternative to this, we navigate to Backlog view and from there we track the Active Sprint tickets. The Active Sprint view should provide option to enable or disable the view of sub-tasks for the tickets. I mean, more customization here would really help users to make their own choices.\n",

I have found it really helpful when it comes to providing upgrades to the projector to administer a project in development stages. It's all in one package. It has the board where you can re-protize your user stories in backlog by shuffling through pick and drop feature for the development team through tasks as well as can prioritize issues reported by the customer. You can write the user stories and just need to manage on the board. You just need to monitor the board to track the progress of the critical item and estimate overall progress. Workflow templates are available that can be selected to select the process a team wishes to follow or a path to take to address the release or apply patches on customer system. You can add the workflow by create one in the system and add the additional steps like unit testing, system testing etc as per the team. Another helpful feature that I love about this tool is that I allows integration with multiple other tools that makes it even better. Overall I think it's a remarkable tool that is making the software handling experience easy and simple.\ncons: The only thing that I hate about this tool from atlastian is that it have a lot of the patches applied and part of constant changes. We need to scratch for sometime when configuration have to be modified or any existing thing changed. It takes for a while to get your hand adjusted on the system but when are down it's always good experience using it\n",

We need solutions that seamlessly connect strategy, customer research, and proposition development with the people responsible for building and delivering those customer experiences. Compared to the new tools available, Jira feels pretty rigid—you can’t easily tweak fields or settings to fit the way different teams work\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Improves productivity, but misses a few basic features to make it even better\npros: The standout features are the high level of customisability and the development integrations. I was able to set up automations based on our pipelines. We used Bitbucket from Atlassian as a version control system, so the integrations worked even better. I like that the platform is fairly friendly for smaller dev teams, too. While some features are price-locked behind higher tier plans, it's doable for small teams with lower budget, too. When you need extensions, that's also manageable because most of them are free or cheap under 10 users.\ncons: I had two major problems. First on is that automations are very limited in executions on the lower tier plans. Actions like \"assign on transition\" should be a basic thing that's included in all plans, unlimited. Assigning tasks to the right person at the right time is crucial for lean operations. Second is that project duplication doesn't work very well. You lose some of the issue schemes, workflows, etc. At the same time, every time you create a new project, Jira creates new schemes/workflows for it - even if you use the same ones for all of your projects. That creates clutter, and to my knowledge it was impossible to set up a project template in Jira cloud. Other than that, at times, the interface can encounter bugs. That's understandable with the complexity of the product, but it's still annoying.\n",

One of its major achievements is that it has a good reputation and almost everyone working in an agile way has used id,listened of it or at least tried it once. It is a powerfull tool to micromanage a team ,track the tasks, monitor the blocking tasks and measure the contribution of team members.\ncons: Jira comes with some deficiencies. When the team scales it becomes much more expensive,something that is difficult for small teams to afford. It is quite difficult to track the history if you haven't used everything from naming to giving the proper tabs something that might be difficult from the early steps of the project to be known. Last but not least , JIRA is user friendly , though it is quite difficult to structure the project inside it , and i cant imagine how a large group of lets say 20 people can communicate properly using JIRA.\n",

Jira allows project managers to create projects, their backlogs, and Kanban boards. You can move tasks through all phases of a project, from Backlog to Done, set as Ongoing, duplicate them, attach files to them. You can see tasks in retrospective to check how the work was actually performed and find deviations, among other features.\ncons: As with any tool that is useful and complete, it is complex. It takes time and dedication to learn all that has to be learned about Jira. I do project management of a limited complexity and have had to do the full walk around of the tool to be able to feel comfortable using it. I have been using it for over 6 months now and I feel fully confident that I can find everything I need to find. One thing that could definitely be improved is that task cards do not allow to create checklists, which I find to be very useful. On the other hand, each card has a content field that allows you to create lists (numbered or bulleted), as you would do in Word. This is my workaround solution to checklists.\n",

It has a sober and intuitive interface, similar to other project management software. However, at the beginning I needed some training for its use. What makes it attractive are the following features: 1. You can work Agile and Scrum with Kanban or Scrum boards. 2. It is oriented to incidents. So it has a very powerful engine for its creation and management. 3. Planning of agile roadmaps. I think this is what fascinates me most about this tool. Portfolio for Jira helps you create a plan, get an overall perspective, track progress and share your plan with stakeholders. That saves many inconveniences, since you can visualize if something is not working out as planned and in this way apply other strategies. 4. Finally, this software is scalable. Have the project management designed for teams of any size or condition, allowing you to add or change fields.\ncons: There is nothing bad I can say about the operation or performance of the software, since both the company that did it, as well as other companies that have developed plugins keep it updated and functional. The only disadvantage is that in fact the license is not cheap, and if you want to add add-on you have to pay for each of them. Therefore, this tool is intended to be used by large companies.\n",

As it has free pricing for members less than 10, there have been no blockers since the start of the current project, and following scrum has been no problem due to its features.\ncons: Although there have not been any blockers on the project due to Jira, there could be a few interface changes that could benefit everyone. Currently, there are no easy ways to know that an issue contains child issues without clicking on the issue and viewing it, and the outer interface provides no clue about it. The user interface can also feel complex at the beginning and learning it might take a bit of time.\n",

It's so easy to interact with the JIRA assignee or the reporter. One can by simply address someone by typing \"@\" and the name of the person(which gets auto populated as you type the initials of the name). Moreover, any important text can be highlighted by using \"per-formatted\" option available in the \"Text\" or \"Visual\" Format options. It allows your comment to be readable to selected audience as well based on the selected option.\ncons: The only thing which i hate or would like to get changed is the Window size while creating a new JIRA. A small window instead of a new page pops up while hitting the \"Create\" option. This makes a bit difficult for user to punch in the required details to open a new JIRA.\n",

Story/Task creation dialogs can become over crowded so the administrator needs to be judicious about the customized design. - The reports seem a little rudimentary at times, however this may be due to a lack of user diligence in keeping their stories up to date.\n",

Everything from GitHub hooks, customizable status flows and testing suite integrations are available and easy to work with.\ncons: In my usage, I feel that JIRA often feels bloated and sluggish, especially with regards to the amount of time it takes to load a ticket page. Additionally, JIRA pages often become quite cluttered and there are frequently large lags between when certain components on the page load. For example, if I want to change the user assigned to a ticket, I often have to wait for the name of the person to actually load while the ticket status loaded several seconds beforehand.\n",

If you take the time to customize the interface, add fields, workflows, etc. that match your business model, JIRA can make your organization so much more transparent and efficient. Combined with it's siblings Confluence, BitBucket, et. al. you have an amazing suite of productivity tools. Each individual may feel that they are doing a little more than they used to when adding information into these tools, but the time saved in meetings, querying peers for information & not having the full picture will soon become apparent. To get the most of JIRA, be prepared to customize and train. Without those two pieces, you may end up with users who don't see or feel the benefit.\ncons: The least appealing thing about JIRA and the other tools in the Atlassian suite is the fact that you must buy plug-ins to get a lot of functionality that should have been built in.

Overall, this is a great project management tool to use.\ncons: As compared to other platforms like Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services), this tool doesn't provide much more features and support for functionalities. Anyone would prefer to use Azure DevOps as it is a complete DevOps solution as well as a Project management tool with decent pricing for corporates and also free pricing for a team of 5.\n",

Planning sprints, releasing sprints, and looking at history of what was done is very organized.\ncons: Cumbersome to setup. Workflows for issues and UI/UX for creating them is not easy to understand. Sure you can figure it out, but it will require a lot of facepalms. It's good for larger organizations with several cross-functional teams, but if you are a smaller organization stick with Trello and checklists for the cards if sub-tasks are needed. The sub-tasks in Jira are just plain awful to work with, and will end up wasting a lot of time for your team.\n",

Super flexible, fast and easy to use, even when I'm doing Admin work that I don't do everyday and can't remember exactly how to do it.

It allows you to create custom workflows (swim lanes) as your stories/tasks are worked on which is valuable if your team does things in a non-standard manner. Most items can be easily modified through inline editing, and the reports and status board provide a good way to get a feel for where you're going and where you've been.\ncons: While there is a lot of data within JIRA to manage your project, it is poorly managed in a lot of pages. For example, you must assign a story to a sprint in order to be able to assign points to it. This prevents you from doing some early pointing of stories before they go into a sprint. Likewise, certain fields are only available in certain views, which makes it a hassle to manage on a day to day basis.

That said, I have really appreciated the many features and functions of this software. But I appreciate most is the ability to hand off tasks to other members with minimal data input. Some software makes it difficult to input information, and I find this one doesn’t require a lot to get a new task started. I also quite appreciate the ability to set priorities and timelines. In the past, software like this made it easy to forget long-term goals or less important tasks that would later become more important. I need to do more delving to find other features, but another perk would be to tie this program in with my I calendar for better personal management within the project.\ncons: It’s perhaps a small silly thing, but I would like to be able to change the colour of the app. Blue on white is really getting old, to my designer eyeballs.\n",

Jira also comes with a vast variety of built-in reports to analyze your team velocity, burndown, burnup and more key primary indicators to support decisions of the project directory.\ncons: Can't said there is something that I don't like, but if there is something worth mentioning is that some custom widget/components that you add as options for your user stories details are extra and not included with the platform licencing price, however, some components are totally worth it and deserved to be bought.\n",

We were able to deploy and integrate our software development team contributions with continuous integration, QA testing, and sprint schedules. Project management of several groups was a breeze. Our teams were across 15 timezones and in-house.\ncons: It has a steep learning curve upfront. I came from Trello and a small in-house team so learning to use JIRA and apply it to a QA team with a remote user, a remote development team, a supervisor for reporting, and in-house developers was a bit of a struggle at first. Up to that point, every task was in Trello and we had no sprint schedules implemented.\n",

Jira can fit any type of team management needs, not only software developers. And it can handle multiple types of user access and authentications. It has an API that allows to query and control using web services.\ncons: It could have a better UI for admins when configuring fields and schemes, since it can grow out of control when having the same instance for multiple teams in a large scale organization. The list of fields and schemes are not paginated so it can take a while to load the page when there are thousands of elements to be displayed.\n",

The functionality of giving and customize different types of status to tickets is specially valuable, and the options to set up sprints with different types of boards like Kanban or Scrum is a good point as well. It is also nice how it synchronizes with other Atlassian soluitions like Confluence. The UX is easy and intuitive while having many different options for all types of users.\ncons: If you set up many boards or sprints at the same time you can sometimes get a bit lost, it is not much transparent which boards you have created and which tickets are inside. Some options could not be done to specific issue category, for example, you can only create subtask issues from an issue set up as a \"task\", it would useful if this type of options become available regardless of the issue category.\n",

        "review_detail": "title: Review for Jira as a developer\npros: Jira is excellent at keeping track of our issues and linking between them on a kanban board. It was our introduction to a Kanban system of tickets. There are also many features we see ourselves using that we are on the verge of delving into, allowing us to focus on the tickets now but expand in the near future. I like that tickets are easily linked to each other. Our previous system made it difficult to know which tickets were related, while Jira has several options for relating tickets (related to, duplicates, blocked / blocks/ etc)\ncons: I think the price can get high depending on how big your team is. We were just over the free limit which becomes a large cost, especially once you include subscriptions to confluence etc. I think the load times and UI can get buggy at times, there are multiple times a day I have to click through menus several times for it to register. This is by far the most frustrating thing, especially when you have many tickets on a page. One issue we had was that our current ticket system allows us to CC users onto tickets so they (+ anyone else we add) can get an update. This was not possible through regular Jira, however something similar could be done with effort on the Jira Service Management side.\n",

You have to have a good grasp of what you want from it to make sure you get what you really need. It is not friendly for the non-technical user looking to create a workspace.\n",

It won't add a ton of value if your team is not already organized, but it works pretty well once you have a certain degree of organization and understanding of the platform. It's very easy to use Jira in its simplest form.\ncons: Jira continues to surprise and frustrate me despite my years of using it. This is partly because of how I've seen it used -- e.g., organization locks it down to an almost inflexible state -- rather than the software itself, but I think Jira encourages some inflexibility. Jira is also pretty hard to \"master,\" especially when it is locked down. Some fundamentals, such as backlog management and reporting, can be very painful without teams organizing around the platform. Despite its apparent simplicity, Jira, or at least some of its aspect, feel ineluctably like time-sinks.\n",

We have used it for over 6 years now at work and it has always performed its best. - There is an option to customize workflows for each project, depending on the team involved. This helps a lot because we can adapt it to our needs, rather than get adapted to the tool ourselves. - We used it in conjunction with Confluence and one of the features we found very convenient for our team was the fact that you can write down minutes in the Confluence and transform the tasks mentioned there into JIRA tasks right away. - JIRA offers a multitude of integrations and additional features that you can add based on your project's requirements - User permissions are extensive in the way you can tailor them for your needs. Some of our clients are technically advanced, so we give them access to view the board so they can see the progress.\ncons: - I haven't been the one who set it up, despite having admin rights, so at times it was hard to understand where something should go or where something can be changed.

Over the last few years, this product has really matured. When we started with it as an immature FOSS offering, it wasn't really enterprise-class. We were motivated by cost initially, but Atlassian has really grown it. Now with external directory integration, tiered hosting offerings, MSP-level features, and significant customization available, I can't think of another product that beats the value proposition. My most favorite feature? The return on investment. We use this to manage service desk interactions with more than 25 MSP clients, and have never been let down. It costs us less than weekly staff meeting pizza to operate and integration with other Atlassian products is superb.\ncons: Much of the branding customizations fall flat.

It is too easy to fall down rabbit holes of dependencies and child tasks and not be able to find what you were looking for to begin with. The issue numbering system also feels a bit too technical and can create confusion between parent and child tasks.

It has all the important features for assigning work to team members, tracking how long each task takes, notifications, capturing comments and hours worked. The tools allows for the flexibility to create your own JIRA ticket types or categories, with any kind of number of input fields. Data fields may be dropdown boxes, tags, values, or free text. Fields inherently have the ability to recognize hyperlinks and add those in once you type out a link, and it also recognizes JIRA links, such that if you enter a JIRA ID tag, it automatically creates a hyperlink to that JIRA entry. JIRA supports Agile development schemes and tickets could be easily tracked through a JIRA Dashboard. JIRA filters are also easy to use. You may use the basic query that provides you with simple dropdown fields for common elements, or you can create more advanced queries using JQL.\ncons: Being a JIRA user can be limiting as you only have the ability to enter data for the fields that are currently configured. You have to go through IT or the admins for any form of customization such as adding/removing/hiding fields, setting what kind of text format is in each field (e.g. plain text vs rich text) and modifying which fields are required vs optional. When you have rich text formatting, sometimes it can be frustrating getting the text to show up the way you want. The workaround for this would be to use the Text tab instead of the Visual tab so that you can modify the formatting tags.\n",

Hence, additional time and training is required before new members can start working on the same. Jira lacks communication features with team.\n",

For instance, PowerBI Connector for business intelligence, Confluence to make integrated documentation, Structure to manage projects easy an efficiently, Tempo to make Work planning, and a ton more.\ncons: You have some basic features or details missing and you have to contract services to get the things as you needed. For instance you can get Original Estimate to manipulate autofill or sort of, you can do it thru ScriptRunning which is a service for a monthly fee.

Straightforward key management. * High-volume (detailed) logging. Good separation of app config/data and app files. * Runs on a standard Tomcat build. While you're required to use their included version, customizing it is done the usual Tomcat way, and allows for easy configuring Apache or caching front-ends.\ncons: * Big and complex. It has a heavy footprint and can be sluggish * Heavy installers and overlap between products. Eg, the full install (tomcat and pieces) is bundled with every product, requiring some integration effort if you don't really want to run several tomcat instances (see \"heavy footprint\") * Very poor error management. Doing migrations between servers or from cloud to hosted can result in mystery errors that the UI should be able to identify or repair, instead rough DB fixes are required. * Eg, a plugin is somehow disabled by an error condition. Rather than offering a UI to re-enable it, or to clear the setting, or reinstall, instead you can't reinstall the plugin (error) and have to go find the DB entry where it's \"off\", and set it \"on\". That would be expected in a v1 product, but Jira is how many versions old now? * And DB fixes require shutting down the service and then restarting it (a sluggish process).\n",

It takes a bit of wrangling to get the hang of it, and some features, like contact management and email automation, aren't as flash as what you'd find in a dedicated CRM. Plus, it's a bit pricey for smaller sales teams.\n",

The DevOps who was doing all that work left the company.An external audit was hired that provided workers spread all over the world, Spain, India, Latam...So we find ourselves with a lot of work, from very different areas, work environments and projects of all kinds and just one person to manage everything.With Jira we all worked under the same environment to organize tasks, but above all incidents and bugs, and with the need to manage the priorities of each new element that entered our work boards.At a glance, I could assign tasks, review code, refactor or modify it, and upload it to the test servers. Review the tickets, with screenshots of the errors or the new results that should be obtained. Keep in touch with everyone from one place and also receive all feedback in Jira.It was months of hard work, without Jira it would have been impossible to manage it.\ncons: Despite having Jira with everything necessary for software development, sometimes it becomes more complex and less visual than if we accompany it with some extras, also from Atlassian. So it is easier for some boards or planning to use Trello, GitHub or Bitbucket for continuous integration, Sourcetree to make the different branches and versions more visual, Composer for team collaboration...\n",

We're forever fine tuning how how development flows are setup and I've never run into an issue where what we wanted to achieve could not be possible. The workflow editor is pretty straight forward once you figure out how to map these to specific projects and features. It also has a mammoth number of apps that can integrate with it, which can greatly help simplify your organisations stack. We use a bunch of apps that connect to Jira such as Slack and Git. The mobile app is pretty good and more simple to use. There's also a new iOS app that you can run on a mac that seems to be a slightly faster and more user friendly version. However, I haven't quite worked out how to tailor the notifications. The search is very powerful!\ncons: It is very slow to load pages and jump between stories. When using this on a daily basis it really gets annoying. When we need to change a setting it's hard to work out where to go. I have to say I've never seen another app quite like Jira which has so many different places to go to in order to change very similar settings. If someone accidentally creates a ticket with the wrong type the only way to change it is to Move the ticket. And I can't seem to change the status of the ticket at the same time. So often an Open bug ticket becomes an Open feature ticket, which really should still be in Draft.\n",

It was great to have the ability to go and play in a sandbox environment and carefully evaluate what it can and cannot do for me and how it can add value to my organization. Set up and gaining access was easy and quick. The different permissioning levels make sense to stay organized and maintain accurate information. Some of the features I liked the most was having a great UI for exploring and learning without much training. I was personally tasked with setting up a couple of projects and the respective boards for my teams and I was able to do that in a pretty self-serve way. The design is minimalistic and doesn't feel overwhelming, it is clean and navigable. Easily creating backlogs, sprints and administering those are also my favorite features because it makes it so easy to implement an Agile project management and software development culture. The categories of initiatives, epics, stories, tasks etc. align very well with the Agile methodologies in following the same hierarchy. I love being able to get a quick summary view of the tasks before diving deep into the details. Assigning owners, labeling, story points to track work effort needed, description fields, attachments, comments and seamless integrations with other products make it all the more user-friendly. Kanban Board views in Active Sprints tabs provides a clearly easy to understand view of progress.\ncons: Managing boards within each project is the first that comes to mind. Jira does not offer a standard naming convention for the projects and boards and this can cause some major confusion. I have hard coding this manually and training people to do the same to ensure consistency. If you attached Lucidchart diagrams or embed other important document within tasks or epics, they don't update in real-time or even with refresh which is frustrating. This runs the risk of people getting outdated information which can misinform their actions. The search functionality within Jira is also something that I like the least. It does not return optimal results or even close to optimal results. Sometimes it does not search for metadata and you have to remember the actual word you're searching for to track down a task. It returns an overwhelming amount of results and the filtering or sorting options available are confusing and hard to understand. Another limitation is that even though one project can have multiple boards within, it can only have the one same backlog of items which does not make sense to me. There also cannot be multiple sprints running across different boards and all of this makes me wonder what the actual difference between projects and boards are. Jira also lacks some automation in moving tasks to different statuses upon completion. The workflows are suboptimal and don't work as intended most times. The reporting capabilities within Jira are also quite weak in my opinion.\n",

The ability to track the executions of tests and bugs Great adaptability with Gherkin and Cucumber It goes perfectly with ISTQB standards for testing Perfect for both Scrum and Kanban users The great boards and views provided by Jira (followup dashboards, sprint board, ..) The ability to add Xray or Zephir or whatever test plugin that suits you\ncons: Jira users must receive a training before starting to use the software since it can be a little complex to use the software for the first time For testers you cannot execute the same test case more than once in the same test execution It gets more and more difficult when end to end testing multiple applications at the same time\n",

Not only can you customize your dashboard/homepage to show what is most important to you personally, you can also customize the way projects/tickets are created and what fields do/do not show up depending on other factors within that project/ticket itself. I also love the \"Epic\" feature that was semi-recently added which helps you to organize tickets into higher-level projects.\ncons: There's not much I don't like about Jira but one thing that I've found I dislike with the recent interface update is that there are a few bugs with adding/downloading attachments to tickets. A lot of the time I've resorted to clicking the \"use old interface\" button in order to get done what I'm trying to accomplish. The new interface has been around for a while now (I think at least 6 months) and I haven't seen any changes/fixes made yet.\n",

To be fair, this has happened less in the last couple years, but when it's down it really slows our teams production to a halt. The analytics needs work. I'm specifically thinking about the \"burn down\" chart my scrum master uses. The goal post seems to move instead of the chart reflecting what is truly happening.\n",

What is great about the tool is its extensiveness of its features. The ability to trace changes, have people collaborate on the task itself, assign tasks to specific people and link them with dependencies are my favourite features. I'm currently using the roadmap feature in JIRA which provides a really nice traditional gaant chart view. This aids communication with stakeholders who do not need to dive into the details. Lastly, I'll comment on the ability to create custom search queries to build reporting that best suits your needs.\ncons: There is a bit of a trial and error aspect to using the software. Since there are many functions - especially with starting sprints and ability to customize fields - there are sometimes occurrences where the outcome of certain functions are not clear. This requires testing and experience with the tool to truly use it to its full potential.\n",

It allows for great customizability. For example, it allows creating any type of field in a task, allowing managers to better manage and track tasks. Kanban boards are also a great way to get the team used to SCRUM methodologies.\ncons: Although Jira is powerful, it is complex and sometimes not intuitive. For example, filtering tasks for boards with \"SQL-Like\" queries is great, but the language is not as easy as it seems and requires a high learning curve. Finally, even though a lot of apps are available for Jira, a better selection of 3rd party tools would be great\n",

Release menu provide the clear view on the progress of the different release version on the single display. Best thing of JIRA software is we can select our own work cycle as per the organisation standards or by the size of company. Integration with the other third party tools like bamboo to view the build status help to get the real-time status on the release process bar.\ncons: The third party APIs we are working with are expensive. So we are developing own APIs which is complex. The documentation and on screen help should be more systematic. Support and ticket solving process are the areas where JIRA can work on.\n",

The flexibility to create and manage multiple projects, each with its unique workflow, is invaluable.

It contains several levels (Teams, Projects) that may support the structure of the entire business, creating just the correct amount of separation while also allowing for the proper linkages between the various teams inside the business. May be easily integrated with the entire Atlassian ecosystem (Bitbucket, Confluence), and I highly encourage doing so because you'll have a ton of places to store any piece of your project (code, backlog, sprints, documentation). It provides you with all the tools you need to manage any Scrum or Canvas team, albeit I must stress that you will benefit more from adopting Scrum. It makes for incredibly inventive automatic build ticket systems and is simple to incorporate via code.\ncons: It's expensive and difficult to say whether it's the best tool for tiny independent teams when there are many free choices available that can manage numerous users. That is in fact the best option for businesses, but for low-budget teams, it's definitely safer to use a free alternative with no membership cap.\n",

Having a rich API is also something I value a lot. Extension through marketplace module is also a big plus.\ncons: Well, Jira Cloud is perfect to handle agile projects, but you have to struggle a lot when you need to address fixed price projects with strict budget management and a clear separation between your customers and your internal teams. Time tracking could also be better (without requiring extra module/money with Tempo). The ability to group projects (of have subprojects) is also missing\n",

It is highly customizable, and allows you to create your own workflows, issue types, and fields. This means that you can set up Jira to match your team's specific needs and processes, which can greatly improve efficiency and productivity. Another benefit of Jira is its integrations with other tools, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Confluence. This allows for seamless collaboration between team members and tools, and ensures that everyone is working on the same page.\ncons: However, one downside of Jira is its steep learning curve. While the flexibility of Jira is a big advantage, it also means that the software can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for new users. Additionally, Jira can be slow and resource-intensive, which can be frustrating for users who are trying to work quickly and efficiently.\n",

Ciò significa che tutti i task da realizzare possono essere inseriti in un cd. \"backlog\" e quindi assegnati alle persone che li prendono in carica, fissando scadenze. Una delle caratteristiche positive è che le attività possono essere spostate da una sezione all'altra senza vincoli (quindi un'attività può essere spostata dalla sezione \"da fare\" a quella \"test\" ma anche viceversa). JIRA dà la possibilità di visualizzare con un unico colpo d'occhio come sono distribuite le attività di progetto sia per quanto riguarda il numero di attività assegnate a ciascuna persona, sia per quanto riguarda le attività considerate per ciascuno stream. Infine dà una visione immediata di quante sono le attività completate e quante quelle in ritardo\ncons: JIRA ha enormi potenzialità ma richiede parecchia formazione per sfruttare al meglio tutte le risorse.

There is a nice ability to enter a ticket name and number, and it'll let you see the status of that ticket right then and there. It is overall serviceable and for basic ticket creation, tracking, and updating, you have what you need if you need a SaaS project/ticket management system.\ncons: Quality of life features are lacking, often neglected for years, before being closed out as an issue that won't be resolved. Examples of QoL features lacking are: Inability to open links in a new window (this even extends to the Atlassian website...), sorting tickets by name/title (absolutely awful if you are working with them in a specific order), filters timing out after an amount of time requiring a hard refresh, no easily accessed filter for tickets watched (you'll have to figure out how to do this manually). The software also is quite slow in certain parts. Another gripe is the eventually forced UI update, due to the fact that it OBSCURES MORE information off the bat, which is exactly what you wouldn't want when looking at a ticket's details. Their JIRA Slack apps also have a very annoying 'feature' that constantly bugs you to let it connect to your account, with no option to permanently block it - only temporarily snooze.\n",

Initially developed by developers for developers, JIRA is a powerful tool that captures more than just the project management aspect of any development project. JIRA offers a complete suite of issue tracking throughout the development life cycle. Starting with the backlog and planning, JIRA lets you layout your entire project across as many iterations (Sprints) as necessary. It provides ease of tracking the project progress and offers a host of tools for collaboration such as commenting threads. Projects and their projects can also be tracked across releases, with its release management capabilities, and provide comprehensive reports on performance and progress. JIRA is extremely flexible and offers pre-set templates across all functionalities, and allows you to modify them as neededto fit your team and organization's needs. Unlike some products with rigidity built into them, JIRA allows you to define how your team works. JIRA has a vast number of integrations and add-ons to further enhance its capabilities.\ncons: JIRA is very powerful and very detailed. So much so, that some users often find it quite cumbersome if their development environments are not complex. Essentially, JIRA fits beautifully in any environment, but is extremely robust for enterprise environments, making it perceptively complex in small simple projects.\n",

Flat-fee pricing for small teams is very competitive for the amount of power it provides.\ncons: Way too much overhead to actually get started.

They sacrifice usability for flexibility, which is a blessing and a curse.

There's also a lot of tools to track time or effort planned or spent, with plenty of fully configurable charts and their very own sql-like query language. If you like fiddling with this kind of things, you can get interesting information out of it, all for the benefit of the team. Atlassian tools are well integrated and Confluence is a nice tool, too.\ncons: In our case of highly regulated environment, Jira doesn't seem to be compliant with some specific regulations and we can't use it directly as the main tracking tool. Using the cloud solution, you'll often see changes that might surprise you and get in the way while working, and some times it gets pretty slow (that might be due to the oceanic distance from the servers). At first impact, coming from a cork board and paper, we needed some time to get used to the small screen.

It also supports a great deal of integratino with other software making it easy to input and extract data.\ncons: The design of Jira has certain drawbacks for certain groups of developers. There are lots of useful tools for managers who want to look at burn down charts, but in many ways it is not as friendly to people working out of it individually, such as QA analysts and Software engineers. A lot of time it introduces clunky workflow steps which have a beneffit for those who are running project, but are simply extra work for anyone working on projects.\n",

However, I suppose they could include more guiding principles in the template for less frequent users to spare unnecessary hassles.

It allows you to monitor your projects and provided granulated access to individuals. You (or your admin) can set roles for the project and associates those roles to certain activities and then associate the roles even further to individuals. You can organize your tickets in sprints and releases as well as monitor workload and task assignment to your team during sprints (or whatever other form of software delivery you wish to choose).\ncons: Pricing model. Currently, you have a choice of server vs cloud setup. If you have a team that can maintain the server instance, I'd recommend going to server because you have a lot more plugins you can use on server and you can set it up the way you want. The best thing is the licenses are a one-time cost, as opposed to lower, but monthly and forever costs on the cloud portion. The other thing that is to be considered is that the plugins you choose need to have the same level of range for hte user count. i.e if your jira is for 101-250 users, all your plugins will need a license level of the same range, i.e 101-250 users.

I use it to keep track of my tickets like incidents, alerts, and service requests. The tool is super easy to use and one can learn it easily. The ticket management is absolutely great. Jira allows the user to create various filters and dashboards to keep a track of his/her various tickets, tasks, and requests. Multiple dashboards can be created as per project needs and can be shared easily with the team members to improve collaboration and communication within the team. Jira allows has tools to create data analytics which can help the user understand the day-to-day work in depth easily. One does not have to manually work on the data, and can simply use the analysis tools provided by Jira. Keeping a track of others' tickets is also very simple, and all one needs to do is add oneself as a watcher in whichever he/she wishes to. Another great feature of this software is closing multiple incidents/alerts/tickets in bulk. Having used this functionality on a daily basis, I know how much time and energy is saved which can be better utilized. There is also a mobile application available which can be used when a laptop/desktop is not available to the user.\ncons: The only drawback I have experienced while using Jira is that it does not provide an option to have sound notifications. For example, while working with tickets, Jira does not notify the user of a new ticket with a sound. So when away from the device, the user might miss out on an important ticket unless it has collaborated with another tool like pagerduty. Even the mobile application does not have the option to enable sound notifications, and each time the user needs to open the application to see if any new tickets have been added to the queue.\n",

But as someone who worked with different software solutions before, Jira took the least amount of time to bring in our old projects and set up new ones.\ncons: At times, having so many options can become a disadvantage - you may get lost while trying to create a PERFECT setup, perfect privileges, perfect roles, perfect workflows. My advice - ditch some of the possibilities at first, go simple and build on from there. Unfortunately, JIRA doesn't tell you that itself. Also, Confluence, which feels like a must-have due to how interconnected it is with JIRA, can be a bit pricey for a bigger number of users.\n",

Also the many integrations with other attlassian products is great, it really saves a lot of time and it's a great as documentation. Jira is the reference for software development team, and with good reason1\ncons: It can be costly and there are nasty sides on the licensing. For example, you can't use plugins for a limited number of users, and only pay for that the number of users. Although in some cases I can understand, in some other cases it makes no sense and it's really a barrier. An other nasty side we experienced is the lost of investment when upgrading during a license term. We bought a license for 2 years, without any discount wrt the 1 year license deal. Within the year, we already needed to extend the number of licensed users so we had to upgrade the license. We then had no way to recover a part of the investment of the remaining time of the initial license ... never buy more than 1 year! One last BIG negative is the recent forced move to cloud. We have always ran Jira and Atlassian products on prem. A recent decision by Atlassian is forcing the user away from the current on prem solution. This is simply not what we want or can. I'm sure this will be an issues with several European organizations where the move to cloud wrt GDRP is not that easy or not a company priority.\n",

It brings transparency to the processes and is a great information radiator for the entire team. It facilitates commonly used methodologies such as SCRUM and KANBAN and makes project management significantly easier. It is also very versatile and adaptable to particular needs. Although the standard fields are great, you can also create your own to fine tune your processes. Workflows are also highly customizable, giving the user-base great flexibility on how work is set up. Based on this, teams which work in areas not related to software development can also reap the benefits. I've seen implementations in recruitment, data analysis and more. Another great feature is its integration compatibility with other ecosystems such as Microsoft's which makes it easy to pick up. In terms of services, Atlassian offers multiple ways teams can use Jira: Cloud or Self-managed (Server or Data Center) making it an adaptable offering that can withstand the highest level of corporate security scrutiny. Another great feature is the marketplace which contains a great number of apps that provide added capabilities to the app. Last but not least, Atlassian has developed an entire ecosystem geared towards solving projects (especially software ones)like: Confluence (Info silo), Bitbucket (code management), Service Desk and more.\ncons: The plethora of fields and customizations available can make a new user feel a bit overwhelmed. In this regard, it takes a bit to get used to it. The interface could use a revamp to make things cleaner, clearer and more crisp for the more casual user at least. (ex: easier to find timekeeping, task transitions, new task coloring schemes and more) The workflow engine can also be upgraded to be more user friendly and provide more administrative options (create, apply, delete, manage versions) The security administration section also needs a revamp in terms of adding or removing users, groups, roles into or from project (ex: if you create a new group, you can't bulk add it to all existing projects without some scripting in the CLI)\n",

There is little that Jira cannot do which makes it a no brainer of everything most startups and companies will use. I love that Jira for the most part is a one-stop-shop for Engineering teams, IT teams, Knowledgebase, ticketing systems. You don't really see issues with using Jira until you get bigger. The fact that I can link Jira tickets to my Git commits and add confluence documents to my tickets and google drive files ALL IN ONE is ourtagious and its something my company loves inside and out.\ncons: Just like every software out there you cannot be perfect in all ways. Because Jira is a one-stop-shop the biggest issues we have is customization of Jira. Not because Jira cant be customized, but only because it can be customized so much that we need set Jira admins whos sole job it is to manage Jira for the entire company because of the huge learning curve because it takes so much time how to figure out even the littest changes to make our lives easier. On top of that, a big issues I see if that as you grow in Jira it is a money pit at times to have it scale with the company. At this point, we are so vested in Jira we cannot get off of it. Adding SSO, and Confluence, and CI DI, and all the features that they promote arent dominating their fields, but its like \"Well....

However, Jira offers many integrations, which can help teams to work more efficiently and effectively.\n",

From creating dashboards to managing tasks everything is seamless.

JIRA provides you with a lot of freedom to work with, it is very easy to manage sprints in JIRA as well.\ncons: It sometimes feels like JIRA has way too many features, though it is a project management tool, you will mostly be using a particular set of features in your everyday work, while the tool itself can do a lot more and this will take a long time to learn\n",

Overall, it is a good tool for product/project management.\ncons: As I see a lot of tools daily, I see a bit of ease of use that can make Jira a great product. I hope the developers and product managers of Jira are trying to get that soon.\n",

The real-time updates are a lifesaver - I always know exactly where things stand without having to chase people for status updates.

        "review_detail": "title: Effective Project Management System for the organized team.\npros: My favorite thing in Jira is how good this tool is at supporting structured team-oriented project management – particularly in Agile environments. The platform provides a level of flexibility that allows you to build workflows, task types, and dashboards that suit perfectly the needs of your team. Whether you're managing a simple class project or a multi-layered software rollout, Jira can be adjusted to suit both small and large-scale efforts. Its visual task boards -Kanban and Scrum- make it easy to manage whom is doing what and where each task is at. This not only makes teams organized but it also prevents communication gaps. One of the things that I found really useful is the real-time transparency that it provides. you can instantly see progress updates, bottlenecks, and what's coming next. Jira also has very detailed reporting tools that allow the teams to reflect on how they performed at one point in time. Charts and analytics such as burndown graphs or sprint reports provide clean information as to how works are moving. These features are very convenient for planning further tasks or detecting the places where one can improve. Other strengths include Jira’s ease of interfacing with Confluence, GitHub, Google Workspace among the rest. This helps keep all – documents, code, communication – together in the same ecosystem, which is good for concentrating and being productive.\ncons: And what I did not like most about Jira was the spiked learning curve, especially for new users and the non technical team members. Despite the fact that Jira is an astoundingly powerful and feature-rich tool, the very complexity can make the initial onboarding a little bit confusing. It takes time to know how to switch from one project to another, configure the boards, and use all its tools at maximum potential and occasionally people may require external help or training. The user interface is another aspect that could be enhanced, even though it is operational, it may seem chaotic and non-user-friendly in some areas, especially, when one is trying to switch between varied perspectives or work with personally created workflows. Without forgetting Jira’s many integrations with other third party applications (e.g., GitHub)- their configurations at times can be quite technical and not really a walk in the park for an average joe that had not previously dabbled in such. File management is another little problem – adding, storing shared documents in issues can be not as fluid and accessible as it should be, and especially in comparison to more communication-based platforms. However, the major part of these barriers is bound to fade away with time, as one carries on using them. After becoming accustomed to the platform, it becomes a lot easier to use all the opportunities provided by Jira.\n",

If any new person who has never used JIRA, starts using it, it wouldn't take more than 1-2 days for him/her to fully understand it. Additionally it provides you an option of extracting reports where you can view/track your/your team's performance, the work load and many more things which would help you take decisions. I also like the feature of creating dashboards in JIRA, it gives a rich and professional look to your work, which you can showcase to your team, management and other stakeholders.\ncons: There's not much but the scope of reports and dashboard is sometimes limited like I wish to include more options/filters but I couldn't.\n",

It is highly scalable and provide features to have different kinds of workflows for tracking. 3. It is easy to use and user-friendly and is widely used by business owners and managers to keep track of the project's overall status. 4. It provides time logging as well which is useful to identify the time spent on an issue or user story. 5. It can be integrated with the third-party tools as well and provides a number of add-ons. 6. It helps in speedy delivery of the projects.\ncons: I have found that sometimes it is hard to install add-ons or integrate jira with other tools from a developer's perspective. Most of the times administrator privileges are required for such tasks and jira provides no information about the admin to contact. So, such processes are time-consuming. Jira provides an API for issue management, however, the API has limited set of features and has scope for more rich features.\n",

Workflow management: One can easily create sub-tasks under parent task and assign to different team members. Tags can be used for segregation and reporting as well. Workflow of any task/ bug/ epic can be managed very well directly from the console.\ncons: Learning curve: is quite huge. Jira is a one-man army platform which does not need any other platform.

It has the option to alert the users with email alerts and also reminder mails. There is option to close the ticket, clone the ticket, revoke the ticket. The users can customize the reports and dashboards as per their requirement and download the ticket in various formats from the JIRA tool.\ncons: The reports and dashboards does not provide for reports in a graphical way. The tickets can not be simultaneously assigned two or more users. The tickets can only be closed by the creator which is a set back if the creator does not close the ticket once its gets over. The note which is created allows only text inputs. It does not allow for creation of table or column. Turn around time for closure (at each specific user level) of the ticket can not be generated from the reports automatically. This is a big drawback. Also, it takes so much time for loading the contents and if the internet is slow then it does not get loaded at all.\n",

It's incredibly powerful, fast, stable, and powers all of our cloud, app and firmware deployments/releases by managing the user stories and bugs that go into each release.\ncons: The user interface is now so complex that we have to employ full time people just to wrangle Jira. The PMs themselves are pretty scared of it and would never try to customize it--the TPMs and Sr. TPMs often struggle to do what we need. It can really take on a life of its own because it's so incredibly complex. We have had to move a lot of project management tasks over to Asana because there are so many things messed up and broken about our current Jira (cloud) instance. Bottom line--don't choose Jira unless you've got SDEs that are super adept at it already. If you're just starting out, it's very attractive pricing, but the complexity will kill you.

Some people would say it’s not even that important, however, for growing businesses it’s something you can’t do without. Lots of task tracking is needed all at once, as you can never predict what necessities will arise in a growing company. Jira provides great help with all these issues. Sprints can be structured across multiple tandem-working teams, taking into account their wishes and preferences – either for traditional setups or for newer ones.\ncons: Honestly, one thing that was really off-putting for me was the impressively complex layout. The project list is simply huge, and you have to take some time to grasp the navigation and search features. Perhaps, in the next update the developer needs to add the possibility to tag or somehow categorize or classify projects more clearly to make them easily searchable. Otherwise, it takes a bit too much time. The dashboard is simple, but I don’t much like the visualization for reports. You also can’t assign tickets to several people at the same time. Only the person who created the ticket has the authorization to close it, which is quite bothersome. You can’t create columns or tables, and notes exist only for text input. I would also like to see a feature where you can generate turnaround time for ticket closure in an automatic way using reports. Plus if you have a bad Internet connection, there are issues with loading contents (sometimes the loading even stops altogether).\n",

        "review_detail": "title: JIRA is an amazing tool in a very useful suite of project management software.\npros: JIRA is a great way to track items that need to be done or defects that need to be fixed across a business. If you take the time to customize the interface, add fields, workflows, etc. that match your business model, JIRA can make your organization so much more transparent and efficient. Combined with it's siblings Confluence, BitBucket, et. al. you have an amazing suite of productivity tools. Each individual may feel that they are doing a little more than they used to when adding information into these tools, but the time saved in meetings, querying peers for information & not having the full picture will soon become apparent. To get the most of JIRA, be prepared to customize and train. Without those two pieces, you may end up with users who don't see or feel the benefit.\ncons: The least appealing thing about JIRA and the other tools in the Atlassian suite is the fact that you must buy plug-ins to get a lot of functionality that should have been built in. Atlassian is proud of their App ecosystem, but, from an end user perspective, it can just feel like it is a place grabbing your money.\n",

Multiple users can get involved within the platform and have different subtasks assigned to them. Having the possibility to create workflows keep things simple and easy to see what's the current status of the whole task at a glance. The platform allows for customisation as well, this comes really handy as no project is identical and you may need to add some automations to the process to meet your specific needs. Thanks to their recent Boards implementation, you can see the next tasks that need to be worked on and as well as what's already been done and what's in progress.\ncons: The platform might be a bit overwhelming when you start working with it for the first time. It's hard to know all the possible functionalities until you have worked with it for a while. Although it's possible to customise, some parts can get a bit tricky to perform if you don't have the knowledge. On the other side, you can also reach out to them if you need help. In terms of pricing, it can get a bit expensive if you need a lot of users.\n",

It is mainly adopted by teams following the agile methodology. The overall usability and user experience are unbelievable and the smoothness through which we can switch between different sections of the platform makes it a very usable product. It helps to create Scrum and Kanban projects as well as create and manage tasks, user stories, etc. by these teams. Developers can easily use GIT or TFS to check-in or commit data on the respective servers whereas testers can file relevant bugs or issues encountered for the relevant tasks under a User story. Overall, this is a great project management tool to use.\ncons: As compared to other platforms like Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services), this tool doesn't provide much more features and support for functionalities. Anyone would prefer to use Azure DevOps as it is a complete DevOps solution as well as a Project management tool with decent pricing for corporates and also free pricing for a team of 5.\n",

Sure you can figure it out, but it will require a lot of facepalms. It's good for larger organizations with several cross-functional teams, but if you are a smaller organization stick with Trello and checklists for the cards if sub-tasks are needed. The sub-tasks in Jira are just plain awful to work with, and will end up wasting a lot of time for your team.\n",
